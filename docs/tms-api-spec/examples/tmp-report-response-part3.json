          "As a leader, the Upholder-Maintainer will deal with matters in some depth. Your strength here will be in your ability to grasp a wide understanding of the complex issues at stake, and to commit tremendous energy and effort to push for new approaches.",
          "You try to establish a harmonious, close-knit team and will spend time with those with personal problems or emotional upsets, if you believe they can benefit from your support. While you can be helpful, you can also be tough when required.",
          "As a leader, you will set goals based on your ideals and theories, and will quietly but persistently pursue your objectives. You try to form a group of people who will support and work with you, but if all else fails, you will press on alone. This is particularly so when you really believe in the purpose of the activity. You may, therefore, take leadership in various social and community groups whose ideals and values you support.",
          "Not everyone, however, will appreciate your leadership style, because much of your best work is done by yourself. Indeed, you often enjoy experimenting with new ideas and may not share these until they are well advanced or fully formed. Your colleagues may then have difficulty in understanding how you came to reach your conclusions.",
          "Your enthusiasm is a key strength. You don't believe in letting today's disappointments get in the way of tomorrow. Your ability to come up with new ideas and your optimism will usually engender confidence. However, you will probably react badly to personal criticism and dwell on it rather than accepting it and pressing on.",
          "As a team leader, you can represent and defend the group when you believe that the issues are worth fighting for. At this point, you can become a negotiator and representative who is hard to beat. You will particularly support those who suffer from what you regard as unfair and unjust treatment.",
          "You will normally adopt a quiet approach to leadership, but will let people know where you stand. You like jobs to be finished on time so that everything is left neat and tidy. You will press for a high work standard and will not let people get away with slipshod work. Indeed, some will at times say you can be very critical when people do not meet your high standards.",
          "You exercise leadership by doing rather than just talking and expect others to follow your example. You will probably talk in depth only with those whom you trust. At times, others may say you don't confide in them.",
          "To what extent do you have special, group, problem-solving discussions on the key questions facing you at work? Such discussions give everyone on the team the opportunity to understand your concerns and express their views. Experienced managers have learned this is a useful way of getting people's opinions, even though specific criticisms may emerge. If handled constructively, such sessions can lead to major improvements. However, they need to be held separately from normal business meetings."

Establishes harmonious teams, supports those with problems, tough when required. Sets goals based on ideals, pursues objectives quietly but persistently. Works alone when necessary. Enthusiasm and optimism are key strengths, but sensitive to criticism. Strong negotiator for worthy causes. Quiet leadership style with high standards. Leads by example rather than words."

      "title": "Decision-Making",
      "order": 6,
      "content": {
        "paragraphs": [
          "Your approach to decision-making is heavily influenced by your beliefs and values. This, combined with your imaginative ideas and concern to get things done in an ordered way, will mean you push for action.",
          "On occasions, however, you may make decisions too quickly. You will rely too much on the inspiration of the idea, together with the strength of your beliefs, and may not acquire sufficient information to assess the decision.",
          "In the main, you will have a steady approach, together with a highly intuitive, creative way of gathering information. You are likely to see the world from a very personal, unique viewpoint. Your approach will enable you to reflect quietly and deeply upon matters. This, combined with your creative insight, will often allow you to see possibilities and ideas beyond the facts of the situation.",
          "Other people will not always see the world in the same way as you do. Indeed, they may talk a lot but not really come to grips with the points you feel are important. Your own preferred way of working is usually to listen to what others have to say, but not make a major contribution yourself until you have clarified in your own mind the key points. In general, you like to understand the whole picture before committing yourself. You are usually better able than others to see how things relate and interact, although the specific details and facts may be of little interest to you.",
          "Because you like to resolve and conclude matters, rather than generate a lot of extra data, you could sometimes become impatient with others who either don't share your vision or will not commit themselves. While you prefer to work in a co-operative way, your keenness to implement your ideas can sometimes be seen by others as being 'over enthusiastic'.",
          "You can be extremely keen in your own quiet way and will work for long hours to pursue the job in hand. You do not like to be beaten and will put in tremendous effort if you believe the issue or task is worth doing. You will not easily be thrown off course and can be seen by others as stubborn and obstinate when it comes to changing direction. Essentially, you tend to have commitment to your ideas and the overall purpose, and do not like to be put off. Clearly, this is a strength, but it needs to be played in the context of other people's willingness to go along the path you have decided."

      "content": {
        "paragraphs": [
          "Establishing sound interpersonal relationships is important to you and you usually take time to do this well. You can be particularly concerned for other people's feelings and worries, and like to please and help those in need.",
          "In your own way, you take time to work closely with people and try to understand their concerns. Wherever possible, you will seek to help colleagues and friends, particularly when they are having difficulty in career and work issues. You can often see the potential in others that they may not see or appreciate in themselves.",
          "When you get to know people, you can find the right words to give feedback and encouragement. Your enthusiasm for what you are doing usually rubs off on to others in the team. In return, you will value those who appreciate your efforts and make it clear by word and deed. Working in a supportive team will be important to you. Where it does not exist, you will seek to create it or if that is not possible, you will probably move on.",
          "You can, therefore, work well with those who recognise your concern to support and help. You probably indicate more than others your appreciation of work well done. However, you can be critical when people do not pull their weight or pursue a course which is not the one you believe is correct.",
          "Overall, you can provide a sound basis for improving interpersonal relationships not only in your team but between groups. You have a concern to uphold and maintain relationships, and will work hard to bring people together. Occasionally, those you support may let you down. They may play on your good nature and you will have to make hard decisions as to whether you continue to help and support them and cause risk to yourself and the company.",
          "You can be an effective representative of the organisation when asked to stand up for those things that you believe in, providing you have had time to prepare. On such matters, you can be an effective spokesperson or negotiator. Where, however, you do not identify with the purpose or cause, you will find it difficult to perform such roles with conviction. Play-acting in that sense does not come easily to you, when it cuts across your beliefs and convictions.",
          "Overall, you can generate a high degree of enthusiasm and optimism among your colleagues. You also consider it important for established customs to be upheld and recognition given for service and loyalty.",
          "You can usually communicate well, particularly in the written word, where you often find the right phrase to capture the moment. This can provide the basis for you to involve others in your ideas and ideals, and get them as enthused as yourself on what can be achieved with collective efforts. You can also communicate well orally, particularly when you have had a chance to prepare."
