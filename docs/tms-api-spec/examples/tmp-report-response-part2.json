        "introduction": "These four work preference measures are shown as bipolar scales ranging from 0 to 30 either side of a centre point.",
        "explanation": "By subtracting the lower score from the higher one for each measure, a net score is obtained. These are I: 7; C: 3; B: 5; S: 9 and are the foundation of your major role preference.",
        "interpretationGuide": "Your roles on the Team Management Wheel arise from your preferred approaches to work in four different areas: how you relate with others, how you gather and use information, how you make decisions, how you organise yourself and others."

          "Upholder-Maintainers play an important role in any work team. Their main concern is to set up and maintain standards. They establish close and supportive relationships with those who uphold the beliefs and values they consider important. However, they can at the same time be tough opponents against people who they perceive stand for ideas and decisions to which they are opposed.",
          "Upholder-Maintainers can be key people in generating ideas and views on how an organisation and individuals should do things. The term Upholder-Maintainer is consequently very appropriate for this important team role.",
          "As an Upholder-Maintainer, you will have quite a number of creative ideas which you will interpret through your own values. Where your theories combine with your beliefs, you have the powerful ingredients for taking and advising on action. As you prefer an organised and structured way of doing things, you will usually move to put your plans into practice rather than just thinking about them.",
          "Where your work and beliefs are closely related, you will work extra hard and have confidence in what you are doing. Contributing extra hours in such a situation is part of the challenge. Where your ideas don't support your beliefs, you may not be as highly motivated.",
          "Often other people do not realise how hard you are working because you prefer to do a lot of your best work by yourself. Indeed, you have the capacity to concentrate for long periods of time and to persevere when problems appear. However, you like to balance these intensive periods with lighter moments when you can meet and interact informally with your colleagues.",
          "You may well enjoy working on community activities, where you can contribute to the welfare and well-being of others. This could be through helping children, the elderly, a sports group or some other public cause.",
          "While you will not enjoy being pushed, you can and do work to deadlines. Above all, you take a pride in the quality of your work and will ensure it is done, not only to time but also to a high standard.",
          "You will probably have a strong feeling of what is right and wrong, and will align yourself closely with people of similar beliefs and convictions. Your ability to read people's motives and intentions is something that is important. You can often 'see' their strengths and weaknesses, and emotional make-up soon after you have met them.",
          "You will have a vision of how things should be and will work towards it in a purposeful way. You can work for long periods by yourself in planning and preparation. Overall, you respect other people's feelings and work for what you believe is right, despite opposition on economic or other grounds."
