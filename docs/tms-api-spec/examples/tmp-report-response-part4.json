          "You prefer to have a close group of colleagues who share the same values as you. Establishing a solid 'esprit de corps' is important. You feel people will want to give of their best if they have a harmonious understanding and help each other. You will, therefore, listen to what others have to say and will at times 'bend over backwards' to accommodate their points of view, to hold the team together.",
          "To achieve a balanced team, it is important to have people working with you who have the required skills, but may not share your vision or ideals. To complement your own strengths, you may need to work with Controller-Inspectors, Assessor-Developers, or Reporter-Advisers. If one or more of your related roles are already in these areas you may well be able to provide much of this balance yourself.",
          "In building an effective work team, it is important to share your thoughts and ideas with your colleagues on a regular basis. You may feel it inappropriate to talk through your theories until they are well thought out. Unless, however, your colleagues understand how your thinking is developing, they may feel left behind. Regular discussions can pay big dividends, even if they do take more time.",
          "You probably feel you try to give your team a fair amount of autonomy. While you like to see things done your way, you want everyone to be themselves, so their individual ways of doing things are respected.",
          "Overall, you can build an effective work team when you are able to delegate and trust others. This is, however, difficult when others do not understand or share your ideals, or let you down.",
          "Your greatest strength is the innovative thinking and strong values you bring to the organisation. Others may find it hard to understand these ideas. Your job is to help them appreciate what you see clearly and they can only dimly see. You may be hurt by what you perceive as criticism. Try not to take it personally. Treat criticism of your ideas as a problem statement to be discussed and resolved. You won't always be right and neither will your critics.",
          "You will probably do well in a co-ordinating role, as long as people share your values. You will have an interest not only in advising others, but also in controlling the detail and direction. However, to ensure work gets finished on time, you will probably need others, particularly Concluder-Producers, to complement your efforts."

      "vectorChunk": "Team-Building approach: Prefers close colleagues with shared values. Establishes esprit de corps through harmony and mutual help. Accommodates others' views to maintain unity.

Builds effective teams through delegation and trust. Brings innovative thinking and strong values. Sensitive to criticism. Good in coordinating role when values align."

        "introduction": "Clearly, your approach has a number of strengths which can be extremely useful at work. However, one also needs to look at the other side of these strengths in order to develop a balanced Profile. You may, therefore, find it useful to consider the following points:",

          {
            "text": "You often do your best work when by yourself, rather than talking to others. Communication is, therefore, an important issue, unless you have developed good Linking Skills. You will usually communicate well with a few tried and trusted people, but may perhaps be more reluctant to share your ideas with others at an early stage. If this is so, look at how you can improve communications, so other people can understand your thinking as it develops, rather than having to absorb your innovative ideas in their full version. Your team and colleagues need to be introduced to the complexity of your thinking in a series of ongoing steps."

            "text": "Ideas are your strength. Gathering detailed facts can be your weakness. If so, ensure you have someone working with you who is strong on practical details and the provision of relevant information."

          {
            "text": "When it comes to substantial decisions, you should spend more time doing a detailed, objective analysis of the costs and benefits, rather than just relying on your ideas and beliefs. Again, it may be useful to have someone working with you who is a bit more detached and can look at some of these issues objectively."
          },
          {
            "text": "Once you have developed an idea, your inclination will usually be to get on with the action. However, you will probably need the support of others to fully implement your proposals, given your own preferences for advisory work. A person with a Thruster-Organiser major role preference can be helpful in such situations."
          }
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, you will bring to your job many strengths. In particular, you will play a key role in the team of maintaining relationships and standards, and upholding principles important to the organisation and yourself. Alongside this, you will bring in new ideas and ways of tackling problems, and an ordered approach to dealing with difficulties."
      },
      "vectorChunk": "Areas for Self-Assessment: Communication challenges - works best alone, needs to share thinking earlier with broader group. Ideas strong but fact-gathering weak - needs support for practical details. Decision-making relies on beliefs over objective analysis - needs analytical partner. Implementation requires others' support, particularly Thruster-Organisers. Overall brings strengths in maintaining standards, upholding principles, generating ideas, and structured problem-solving."
