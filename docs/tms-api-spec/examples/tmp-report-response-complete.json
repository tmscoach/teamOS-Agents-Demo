Where your theories combine with your beliefs, you have the powerful ingredients for taking and advising on action. As you prefer an organised and structured way of doing things, you will usually move to put your plans into practice rather than just thinking about them.",

Indeed, you have the capacity to concentrate for long periods of time and to persevere when problems appear. However, you like to balance these intensive periods with lighter moments when you can meet and interact informally with your colleagues.",

You may, therefore, take leadership in various social and community groups whose ideals and values you support.",

Indeed, you often enjoy experimenting with new ideas and may not share these until they are well advanced or fully formed. Your colleagues may then have difficulty in understanding how you came to reach your conclusions.",

Your ability to come up with new ideas and your optimism will usually engender confidence. However, you will probably react badly to personal criticism and dwell on it rather than accepting it and pressing on.",
            "As a team leader, you can represent and defend the group when you believe that the issues are worth fighting for. At this point, you can become a negotiator and representative who is hard to beat. You will particularly support those who suffer from what you regard as unfair and unjust treatment.",

Such discussions give everyone on the team the opportunity to understand your concerns and express their views. Experienced managers have learned this is a useful way of getting people's opinions, even though specific criticisms may emerge. If handled constructively, such sessions can lead to major improvements. However, they need to be held separately from normal business meetings."

You are likely to see the world from a very personal, unique viewpoint. Your approach will enable you to reflect quietly and deeply upon matters. This, combined with your creative insight, will often allow you to see possibilities and ideas beyond the facts of the situation.",

Your own preferred way of working is usually to listen to what others have to say, but not make a major contribution yourself until you have clarified in your own mind the key points. In general, you like to understand the whole picture before committing yourself. You are usually better able than others to see how things relate and interact, although the specific details and facts may be of little interest to you.",

While you prefer to work in a co-operative way, your keenness to implement your ideas can sometimes be seen by others as being 'over enthusiastic'.",

You do not like to be beaten and will put in tremendous effort if you believe the issue or task is worth doing. You will not easily be thrown off course and can be seen by others as stubborn and obstinate when it comes to changing direction. Essentially, you tend to have commitment to your ideas and the overall purpose, and do not like to be put off. Clearly, this is a strength, but it needs to be played in the context of other people's willingness to go along the path you have decided."

Here, you will want to work quietly on your own, ensuring standards are upheld and organisational systems maintained so that everyone can work in an optimum way for the benefit of the organisation. Your related roles lie in the Controller-Inspector and Thruster-Organiser sectors and there are times when you show some of the characteristics of both these sectors. Many people with this pattern of scoring excel in administration management positions.",

On occasions, you will be so concerned to make a decision that you may not hear sufficient of the views being expressed by others. They may even see you as being unprepared to listen, particularly where the decision is related to something that you strongly believe in. To you, however, it is simply a question of efficiency and not letting matters drag on when you believe you have enough information to make a decision.",

Where an analysis supports your beliefs, you will have no hesitation in pushing your ideas forward. Indeed, you may surprise yourself and others at times as to the urgency and commitment you bring to some of the tasks you are involved in. It is at these times that you are more likely to be wearing your Thruster-Organiser 'hat'. Where an analysis is contrary to your beliefs, you are more likely to request further information, hoping to find something that supports your hunches.

In this regard, you may at times have difficulties in delegating.",
