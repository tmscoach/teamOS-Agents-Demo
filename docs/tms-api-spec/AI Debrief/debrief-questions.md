AI-Guided TMP Debrief Conversation Script 

Opening & Rapport Building 

AI TMS Practitioner: Hi Bryan, I'm Alex, an AI specialist in Team Management Systems psychometric tools. I'm here to help you explore and understand your Team Management Profile results. 

Q: How are you feeling today, and what prompted you to complete the TMP assessment? 

Bryan: [Response] 

AI TMS Practitioner: That's great to hear. I can see you're with BHP - you've been there for some time now? 

Q: Before we dive into your results, what aspects of your work style or team dynamics were you most curious about when you decided to take this assessment? 

Setting Expectations 

AI TMS Practitioner: Perfect. So here's how our conversation will flow today. We'll explore your TMP results together - I have your complete profile here showing you as an Upholder-Maintainer with some fascinating insights about your work preferences. 

The session typically takes 20-30 minutes, but we can adjust based on what resonates most with you. I'll help you understand not just what your profile says, but how to practically apply these insights in your role at BHP. 

Q: Any initial questions before we begin exploring your results? 

Core Profile Introduction 

AI TMS Practitioner: Your profile shows you as an Upholder-Maintainer - this is your Major Role on the Team Management Wheel. What's particularly interesting is that you have what we call a "Split Wheel" pattern, which occurs in less than 5% of profiles. 

Q: When you think about your role in maintaining standards and upholding important values in your team, how does that resonate with your day-to-day experience at BHP? 

Exploring Work Preferences (ICBS) 

AI TMS Practitioner: Let's look at your four key work preferences - these really shape how you approach your work: 

You scored as an Introvert (7) - preferring to work quietly and reflect before acting 

Slightly Creative (3) in how you gather information 

Beliefs-based (5) in decision-making 

Strongly Structured (9) in how you organize 

Q: That structured preference is your strongest at 9. Can you tell me about a recent project where your need for organization and systematic planning really helped - or perhaps where it created some challenges? 

Strengths Deep Dive 

AI TMS Practitioner: Your profile highlights some powerful strengths. You bring innovative thinking combined with strong values - you're someone who doesn't just have ideas, but ideas with purpose and meaning behind them. 

One thing that stood out is your ability to concentrate for long periods independently, balanced with what the profile calls "managing by wandering around." 

Q: How do you currently balance that deep, focused work time with staying connected to your team? Are you finding the right rhythm there? 

Leadership Style Exploration 

AI TMS Practitioner: In leadership situations, your profile suggests you lead by example rather than just talking, and you set high standards - sometimes being quite critical when those standards aren't met. 

You also have this interesting dynamic where you'll support team members through difficulties, but can be tough when needed. 

Q: Can you think of a time recently where you had to balance being supportive with holding someone accountable to standards? How did you navigate that? 

Addressing Potential Challenges 

AI TMS Practitioner: Every profile has areas for development. For Upholder-Maintainers, one common challenge is that your best thinking often happens internally, which can sometimes leave team members feeling out of the loop. 

Your profile specifically mentions you may not share ideas until they're fully formed. 

Q: Have you ever experienced a situation where your team was surprised by a decision or direction because they hadn't seen your thinking develop? How might you approach that differently? 

Team Dynamics & Related Roles 

AI TMS Practitioner: Your related roles are Controller-Inspector and Thruster-Organizer - this Split Wheel pattern means you can shift between ensuring quality control, pushing for action, and maintaining standards, though these shifts might sometimes feel like internal conflicts. 

Q: When do you find yourself naturally shifting into that Thruster-Organizer mode - really pushing for action? And when does the Controller-Inspector side emerge? 

Work Preference Distribution 

AI TMS Practitioner: Looking at your work preference distribution, you have the highest preference for: 

Maintaining (19%) - your strongest preference 

Inspecting (15%) 

Organizing and Producing (both 14%) 

Your lowest is Developing (8%) - assessing and testing new approaches. 

Q: Given that developing/testing new approaches is your lowest preference, how do you currently handle situations that require extensive experimentation or piloting? Do you delegate this, or have you found ways to work through it? 

Communication & Linking Skills 

AI TMS Practitioner: The profile suggests people working with you should: 

Give you time to think things through 

Communicate important issues in writing 

Respect your beliefs and values 

Avoid just "dropping in" - scheduling time works better for you 

Q: If you could give your team three specific tips for communicating more effectively with you, based on what we've discussed, what would they be? 

Values & Purpose Alignment 

AI TMS Practitioner: Your profile strongly indicates you work best when your role aligns with your personal values and beliefs. It mentions you might even engage in community or volunteer work. 

Q: How well does your current role at BHP align with your personal values? Are there aspects of the work that feel particularly meaningful to you? 

Action Planning 

AI TMS Practitioner: Based on everything we've discussed, let's identify some practical next steps. 

Q: What's one aspect of your profile that surprised you most, and what's one thing you'd like to experiment with changing in the next month based on these insights? 

Closing & Next Steps 

AI TMS Practitioner: This has been a rich conversation, Bryan. Your Upholder-Maintainer profile with that unique Split Wheel pattern gives you a versatile set of capabilities - from maintaining standards to driving action to ensuring quality. 

The key seems to be recognizing when you're operating in each mode and communicating that to your team. 

Q: What questions do you still have about your profile? And would you like suggestions for how to share these insights with your team at BHP?
