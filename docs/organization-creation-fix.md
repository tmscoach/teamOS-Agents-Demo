# Organization Creation Fix

## Issue
When new managers complete onboarding and provide their organization name, the system was failing to:
1. Create the organization in Clerk
2. Update the database with the organizationId
3. Associate teams with the organization

This resulted in managers having `organizationId: null` and seeing all teams in the system instead of just their own.

## Root Cause
The organization creation code in the chat-streaming route was failing silently due to:
1. Clerk API calls failing in development mode
2. No fallback mechanism for dev/test environments
3. Error only being logged, not handled

## Solution
Updated `/app/api/agents/chat-streaming/route.ts` to:

1. **Detect Development Mode**: Check if we're in dev mode or Clerk is not configured
   ```typescript
   const isDevMode = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && 
     (user.id.startsWith('dev_user_') || !process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY);
   ```

2. **Handle Dev Mode**: Create mock organization IDs in development
   ```typescript
   if (isDevMode) {
     organizationId = `org_dev_${orgName.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, '_')}_${Date.now()}`;
   }
   ```

3. **Update Teams**: Ensure all teams managed by the user are updated with the organizationId
   ```typescript
   await prisma.team.updateMany({
     where: { 
       managerId: dbUser.id,
       organizationId: null
     },
     data: { 
       organizationId: organizationId 
     }
   });
   ```

4. **Fallback Mechanism**: If Clerk API fails in dev, create a fallback organization
   ```typescript
   if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
     const fallbackOrgId = `org_fallback_${orgName.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, '_')}_${Date.now()}`;
     // Update user and teams with fallback ID
   }
   ```

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Create a new manager account
2. Complete onboarding with an organization name
3. Check that organizationId is set in the database
4. Verify data access is properly scoped to the organization

## Manual Fix for Existing Users
For users who already completed onboarding but have null organizationId:
```javascript
// Run in browser console
fetch('/api/test-data-tools/sync-clerk-org', { method: 'POST' })
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(console.log)
```

This syncs their Clerk organization to the database.
