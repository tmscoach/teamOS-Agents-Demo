# Issue #83 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the simplified 4-phase journey system data model updates as specified in Issue #83.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
- Added `JourneyPhase` enum with values: `ONBOARDING`, `ASSESSMENT`, `DEBRIEF`, `CONTINUOUS_ENGAGEMENT`
- Added new fields to User model:
  - `journeyPhase`: Current phase in the journey (enum)
  - `completedAssessments`: JSON field tracking completed assessment types and timestamps
  - `viewedDebriefs`: JSON field tracking viewed debrief reports
  - `teamSignalsEligible`: Boolean flag for Team Signals eligibility
- Kept `journeyStatus` field for backward compatibility

### 2. Database Migration
- Created migration file: `20250714060921_add_journey_phases`
- Migration SQL adds new columns with proper defaults
- Includes data migration logic to map legacy `journeyStatus` to new `journeyPhase`
- Applied to production database via Supabase

### 3. Journey Tracker Updates (`lib/orchestrator/journey-tracker.ts`)
- Modified to use `journeyPhase` directly from database
- Added new methods:
  - `markAssessmentComplete()`: Track completed assessments with results
  - `markDebriefViewed()`: Track viewed debriefs and update Team Signals eligibility
- Maintains backward compatibility with legacy `journeyStatus` field
- Updates both fields during state transitions

### 4. API Route Updates
- Updated `/api/admin/conversations/route.ts` to select and return new journey fields
- Updated `/api/admin/conversations/[id]/route.ts` to include new fields in conversation details
- All new fields are properly exposed in API responses

### 5. Testing and Verification
- Created verification script to confirm migration success
- All users now have new journey fields with proper defaults
- Application builds successfully without type errors
- Sign-in page and authentication flow working correctly

## Implementation Details

### Data Model Design
The new fields support the simplified journey phases:
- `journeyPhase`: Direct mapping to current phase (no computation needed)
- `completedAssessments`: Flexible JSON structure for tracking multiple assessment types
- `viewedDebriefs`: Tracks debrief viewing history with timestamps
- `teamSignalsEligible`: Automatically set when TMP debrief is viewed

### Backward Compatibility
- Legacy `journeyStatus` field maintained and synchronized
- Existing code continues to work while we migrate features
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

### Type Safety
- All new fields have proper TypeScript types
- Prisma generates correct types for the new enum and fields
- API responses include typed journey data

## Next Steps
With the data model in place, the following features can now be implemented:
- Issue #84: Admin dashboard journey tracking
- Issue #85: Journey phase transition logic
- Issue #86: Assessment completion tracking
- Issue #87: Debrief viewing tracking
- Issue #88: Team Signals eligibility logic

## PR Status
Created PR #95 for this implementation, ready for review and merge.
