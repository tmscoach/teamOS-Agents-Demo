# TMS Analysis Documentation

This directory contains the comprehensive analysis of Team Management Systems (TMS) intellectual property, which forms the foundation for the intelligent team transformation system.

## Documents

### [Team Transformation System Analysis](./team_transformation_system_analysis.md)
The complete analysis of 40+ years of TMS IP, including:
- High-performing team characteristics
- Assessment tool specifications  
- Implementation methodologies
- Multi-agent system architecture
- Success and failure patterns

### [System Architecture Diagrams](./diagrams.md)
Visual representations of the system design, including:
- High Energy Teams framework flow
- TMS assessment tools ecosystem
- Multi-agent system architecture
- Tool selection decision tree
- 16-week transformation timeline
- Agent communication sequences
- Core TMS models (Workplace Behaviour Pyramid, Types of Work Wheel)
- Success pattern implementation flow
- Data flow architecture

## Key Findings

1. **High-performing teams** continuously address 8 fundamental questions through the High Energy Teams framework
2. **Four core assessment tools** (TMP, QO2, WoWV, LLP) work together to measure preferences, risk orientation, values, and leadership skills
3. **Implementation typically spans 12-16 weeks** with specific phases and milestones
4. **Multi-agent architecture** naturally emerges from the methodology, requiring 9 specialized agents

## Next Steps

Based on this analysis, the development team can now:
1. Implement the multi-agent system architecture
2. Build assessment tool integrations
3. Create transformation workflow automation
4. Develop the user interface for team managers
