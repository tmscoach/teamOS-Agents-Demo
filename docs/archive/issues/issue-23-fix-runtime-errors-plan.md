# Issue #23 - Fix Runtime Errors on Dashboard and Sign-in Pages

**GitHub Issue**: https://github.com/tmscoach/teamOS-Agents-Demo/issues/23

## Problem Summary
Runtime errors occur when navigating to the dashboard and sign-in pages due to missing Next.js vendor chunks:
- Dashboard: `Error: Cannot find module './vendor-chunks/next.js'`
- Sign-in: `Error: Cannot find module './vendor-chunks/swr.js'`

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Missing Clerk Auth Environment Variables**: The .env file exists but appears to be missing the required Clerk authentication keys
2. **Potential Build/Cache Issues**: Vendor chunks errors typically indicate bundling or module resolution problems
3. **Dependency Issues**: The SWR error suggests potential issues with how dependencies are being resolved

## Solution Approach

### Step 1: Environment Configuration
- Verify .env file has all required Clerk keys from .env.example
- Ensure NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY and CLERK_SECRET_KEY are set
- Verify all Clerk URL configurations are correct

### Step 2: Clean Build Environment
- Remove .next build directory
- Clear node_modules and reinstall dependencies
- Clear any package manager caches

### Step 3: Verify Clerk Integration
- Confirm middleware.ts is properly configured
- Verify ClerkProvider is wrapping the app in layout.tsx
- Check that auth components are properly imported

### Step 4: Testing
- Use Puppeteer MCP to test both pages after fixes
- Verify no runtime errors appear
- Test authentication flow works correctly

### Step 5: Add Tests
- Create tests for authentication flow
- Test protected route access
- Verify error handling

## Implementation Tasks
1. âœ… Create plan document
2. Check and fix environment variables
3. Clean and rebuild project
4. Verify Clerk configuration
5. Test with Puppeteer
6. Write tests
7. Run test suite
8. Create PR

## Expected Outcome
Both /dashboard and /sign-in pages should load without runtime errors, and authentication should work properly.
