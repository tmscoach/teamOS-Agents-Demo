# TMS IP Analysis - Key Findings

## 1. High Energy Teams Framework (Core Model)

The High Energy Teams (HET) Model forms the foundation of the TMS methodology, structured around 8 fundamental questions:

### The 8 Questions of High-Energy Teams:

1. **Who are we?** - Understanding team member differences through:
   - Work Preferences (Team Management Wheel - 8 role preferences)
   - Risk-Orientation (QO2 - Opportunities/Obstacles Quotient)
   - Values (Window on Work Values - 8 value types)

2. **Where are we now?** - Current state assessment:
   - Team balance analysis (role preferences)
   - Risk attitude assessment
   - Values alignment check
   - Team development stage (Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing)
   - SWOT analysis

3. **Where are we going?** - Vision and purpose:
   - Team Purpose Statement (What, Who, How, Outputs, Outcomes)
   - Alignment with organizational vision

4. **How will we get there?** - Implementation planning:
   - Types of Work Wheel (9 critical work functions)
   - Advising, Innovating, Promoting, Developing, Organizing, Producing, Inspecting, Maintaining, Linking

5. **What is expected of us?** - Role clarity:
   - Critical work functions per role
   - Accountability and responsibility definitions
   - Team ground rules based on shared values

6. **What support do we need?** - Development requirements:
   - Team learning processes (CORE process)
   - Individual support (Personal Learning Action Plans)
   - Coaching and mentoring

7. **How effective are we?** - Performance evaluation:
   - Questioning process
   - Benchmarking against standards
   - Team Process Reviews

8. **What recognition do we get?** - Motivation and rewards:
   - Feedback mechanisms
   - Celebrations
   - Remuneration
   - Fringe benefits
   - Promotion opportunities

### Key Models and Tools Identified:

1. **Workplace Behaviour Pyramid** (3 levels):
   - Values (base) - fundamental beliefs
   - Risk-Orientation (middle) - approach to opportunities/obstacles
   - Preferences (top) - visible work preferences

2. **Team Management Wheel** - 8 role preferences:
   - Reporter-Adviser
   - Creator-Innovator
   - Explorer-Promoter
   - Assessor-Developer
   - Thruster-Organiser
   - Concluder-Producer
   - Controller-Inspector
   - Upholder-Maintainer
   - Plus Linker (central coordinating role)

3. **Window on Work Values** - 8 value types in circular model

4. **QO2 (Opportunities-Obstacles Quotient)** - Risk orientation measurement

5. **Types of Work Wheel** - 9 critical work functions (same as implementation functions)

6. **Linking Leadership Model**:
   - People Linking Skills (6 outer skills)
   - Task Linking Skills (5 middle skills)
   - Leadership Linking Skills (2 core skills)

### Implementation Insights:

1. **Sequential Process**: Teams must address questions in order, building on previous answers

2. **Continuous Review**: Not a one-time process but ongoing team development

3. **Tool Integration**: Multiple assessment tools work together to provide comprehensive understanding

4. **Linking is Critical**: Central to all activities, ensuring coordination and integration

5. **Values Foundation**: Shared values underpin all team activities and ground rules

### Transformation Methodology Emerging:

1. **Assessment Phase**: Use multiple tools to understand current state (TMP, QO2, WoWV)
2. **Alignment Phase**: Ensure shared values and clear purpose
3. **Planning Phase**: Use Types of Work to plan implementation
4. **Execution Phase**: Clear roles, accountability, and support systems
5. **Review Phase**: Continuous effectiveness monitoring and recognition

This framework suggests a multi-agent system would need agents that can:
- Assess team and individual profiles
- Guide through the 8 questions systematically
- Coordinate tool selection and deployment
- Monitor progress and provide feedback
- Ensure continuous learning and adaptation

## 2. Team Management Profile (TMP) - Core Assessment Tool

### Key Components:

1. **Four Work Preference Measures (RIDO)**:
   - **Relationships**: Extrovert vs Introvert (how you relate to others)
   - **Information**: Practical vs Creative (how you gather/use information)
   - **Decisions**: Analytical vs Beliefs (how you make decisions)
   - **Organisation**: Structured vs Flexible (how you organize self/others)

2. **Team Management Wheel - 8 Role Preferences**:
   - **Reporter-Adviser**: Patient, information gatherers, avoid conflict
   - **Creator-Innovator**: Future-oriented, independent, idea generators
   - **Explorer-Promoter**: Networkers, persuasive, change advocates
   - **Assessor-Developer**: Analytical, project-focused, opportunity matchers
   - **Thruster-Organiser**: Results-focused, deadline-driven, action-oriented
   - **Concluder-Producer**: Systematic, reliable, efficiency-focused
   - **Controller-Inspector**: Detail-oriented, quality-focused, regulatory
   - **Upholder-Maintainer**: Values-driven, supportive, principle-focused

3. **Linking Skills Model** (13 skills in 3 levels):
   - **People Linking Skills** (6): Active Listening, Communication, Team Relationships, Problem Solving & Counselling, Participative Decision Making, Interface Management
   - **Task Linking Skills** (5): Objectives Setting, Quality Standards, Work Allocation, Team Development, Delegation
   - **Leadership Linking Skills** (2): Motivation, Strategy

### Implementation Insights:

1. **Profile Generation**: 60-item questionnaire measuring preferences across RIDO dimensions
2. **Role Assignment**: Major role + 2 related roles based on preference strengths
3. **Team Balance**: Need diversity across all 8 roles for effectiveness
4. **Communication/Pacing**: Adapt communication style to match others' preferences
5. **Work Allocation**: Match tasks to preferences for optimal engagement (2/3 overlap ideal)

### Transformation Applications:

- Individual assessment provides self-awareness
- Team mapping shows gaps and overlaps
- Linking skills ensure coordination
- Preference-based task allocation increases engagement
- Communication pacing improves collaboration

## Next Steps:
- Read QO2 (risk assessment) handbook
- Read WoWV (values) handbook  
- Read LLP (leadership 360) handbook
- Study questionnaire content
- Examine finished reports
- Review research manuals
