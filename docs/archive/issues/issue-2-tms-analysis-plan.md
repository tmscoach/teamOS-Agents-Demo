# Issue #2: Design Intelligent Team Transformation System - Analysis Plan

**Issue Link**: [GitHub Issue #2](https://github.com/tmscoach/teamOS-Agents-Demo/issues/2)
**Date**: January 7, 2025
**Status**: Blocked - Missing TMS IP Documents

## Critical Blocker Discovered

The `.documentation` directory that should contain all TMS intellectual property documents is missing from the repository. According to CLAUDE.md, this directory should contain:

1. **Accreditation Handbooks/**
   - HET framework
   - TMP (Team Management Profile)
   - QO2 (Qualitative Organization Output 2)
   - WoWV (Ways of Working Values)
   - LLP (Linking Leader Profile)

2. **Questionnaire Content/**
   - Team Signals
   - TMP
   - QO2
   - WoW (Ways of Working)
   - LLP

3. **Finished Report Examples/**
   - Team Signals versions
   - TMP reports
   - QO2 reports
   - WoW reports
   - LLP reports

4. **Research Manuals/**
   - TMP manual
   - QO2 manual
   - WoW manual
   - LLP manual

Without these documents, we cannot proceed with the deep IP analysis required to design the intelligent team transformation system.

## Proposed Resolution

### Option 1: Request Documents
Ask the project owner to add the `.documentation` directory with all TMS IP documents to the repository.

### Option 2: Mock Structure Creation
Create the directory structure and placeholder files to demonstrate how the analysis would proceed once documents are available.

### Option 3: Alternative Approach
Research publicly available information about TMS methodology to create a preliminary analysis framework.

## Planned Analysis Approach (Once Documents Are Available)

### Phase 1: Document Inventory & Organization
1. **Create Document Catalog**
   - List all available documents with metadata
   - Note file formats, sizes, and last modified dates
   - Identify any missing or incomplete documentation

2. **Initial Content Scan**
   - Quick review of each document type
   - Identify key themes and methodologies
   - Note interconnections between tools

### Phase 2: Deep Methodology Analysis

1. **Core Concepts Extraction**
   - Definition of high-performing teams
   - Key performance indicators
   - Transformation stages and milestones

2. **Tool Analysis**
   - Purpose and scope of each assessment tool
   - Interconnections and dependencies
   - Decision criteria for tool selection
   - Optimal implementation sequences

3. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Success patterns from case studies
   - Failure patterns and common pitfalls
   - Best practices across different contexts

4. **Theoretical Foundations**
   - Research methodologies used
   - Evidence base for interventions
   - Academic and practical validation

### Phase 3: Multi-Agent System Design

1. **Agent Architecture**
   - **Onboarding Agent**: Derives action plan from team manager input
   - **Triage Agent**: Routes questions to appropriate specialist agents
   - **Assessment Agent**: Manages and interprets TMS assessments
   - **Debrief Agent**: Explains results to team members and managers
   - **Micro-Learning Agent**: Delivers targeted learning content
   - **Nudge Agent**: Sends timely insights based on profile results
   - **Progress Agent**: Tracks transformation milestones
   - **Adaptation Agent**: Adjusts approach based on team feedback

2. **System Integration**
   - Communication protocols between agents
   - Data flow and storage architecture
   - Decision trees and algorithms
   - Feedback loops and learning mechanisms

3. **Implementation Framework**
   - Phased rollout approach
   - Success metrics and KPIs
   - Risk mitigation strategies
   - Continuous improvement process

### Phase 4: Documentation Creation

1. **Analysis Document Structure**

2. **Visual Artifacts**
   - System architecture diagrams
   - Agent interaction flowcharts
   - Decision trees for tool selection
   - Timeline visualizations

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Action**: Contact project owner about missing `.documentation` directory
2. **While Waiting**: 
   - Set up analysis framework and templates
   - Research publicly available TMS information
   - Prepare data extraction tools
   - Design preliminary agent architecture based on requirements

## Technical Considerations

- Use Python for PDF text extraction and analysis
- Consider using LangChain for agent orchestration patterns
- Implement proper data privacy and security measures
- Design for scalability and extensibility

## Success Criteria Checklist

- [ ] All IP documents analyzed comprehensively
- [ ] Clear definition of high-performing teams documented
- [ ] Tool interconnections mapped with diagrams
- [ ] Decision criteria for tool selection defined
- [ ] Implementation sequences with timelines created
- [ ] 10+ success patterns and 10+ failure patterns identified
- [ ] Multi-agent system architecture designed

**Note**: This plan cannot be executed until the TMS IP documents are added to the repository. The analysis quality and system design accuracy depend entirely on having access to the actual intellectual property documents.
