# Issue 59: Add Favicon Plan

**Issue Link**: https://github.com/[repo]/issues/59  
**Date**: 2025-07-10  
**Issue Description**: Add the favicon to the site

## Problem Analysis

The current favicon is a simple SVG with two circles on a yellow background, which doesn't represent the TeamOS brand. The issue provides a colorful flower logo design that should be used as the favicon.

## Favicon Design

The requested favicon is a colorful flower design with:
- 8 petals in different colors: yellow, orange, pink, purple, blue, light blue, green, and teal
- A gray circle in the center with a white hole
- Represents the TeamOS brand identity

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Create Favicon Files
- Create an SVG version of the colorful flower design
- Generate ICO file from the SVG (for broader browser compatibility)
- Potentially create different sizes (16x16, 32x32, etc.) for optimal display

### 2. Replace Existing Favicons
- Replace `/public/favicon.svg` with the new flower design
- Replace `/public/favicon.ico` with the ICO version
- Keep the configuration in `app/layout.tsx` as it already references these files

### 3. Test Implementation
- Test in development environment
- Check favicon displays correctly in browser tab
- Test in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Verify favicon appears in bookmarks

### 4. Clean Up
- Remove the downloaded temporary file
- Ensure no leftover files from previous attempts

## Technical Approach

1. Since we have a PNG image, I'll create an SVG version that matches the design
2. Use the SVG to generate an ICO file
3. Replace the existing favicon files
4. Test thoroughly before committing

## Previous Attempts

There was a previous attempt (commit 1b59240) that added a "colorful flower logo as site favicon" but it was immediately reverted. We should ensure our implementation works correctly to avoid another revert.
