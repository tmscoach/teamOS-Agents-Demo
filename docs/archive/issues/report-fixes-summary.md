# Report Page Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Auth Service Error - "getTokenForUser is not a function"
**Issue**: The TMSAuthService was missing the `getTokenForUser` method that the report page was trying to call.
**Fix**: Added the missing method as an alias to `getOrCreateToken`:
```typescript
async getTokenForUser(userId: string): Promise<string | null> {
  return this.getOrCreateToken(userId);
}
```

### 2. UnifiedChat Position Inconsistency
**Issue**: The debrief chat was on the right side on the report page, but on the left side on other pages.
**Fix**: Swapped the layout in the report viewer page to put UnifiedChat on the left and report on the right, and changed position from "right-sidebar" to "left-sidebar".

### 3. Mock Data Consistency
**Issue**: When assessment is completed and user moves to DEBRIEF phase, the mock API still showed assessments as "Not Started".
**Fix**: Added code to update the mock data store when journey phase transitions to DEBRIEF:
```typescript
// In /app/api/journey/update-phase/route.ts
if (process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_TMS_API === 'true' && phase === 'DEBRIEF' && subscriptionId) {
  const { mockDataStore } = await import('@/src/lib/mock-tms-api/mock-data-store');
  const subscription = mockDataStore.getSubscription(String(subscriptionId));
  if (subscription) {
    subscription.status = 'completed';
    subscription.completedDate = new Date();
    subscription.completionPercentage = 100;
  }
}
```

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Report Generation**: The report HTML generation may still fail if the JWT token is not properly configured or if the TMS API endpoints are not accessible. The mock API should handle this gracefully.

2. **Debrief Agent Context**: The debrief agent now has proper tools (`search_report_chunks` and `get_report_context`) to access the completed assessment data. It receives the subscriptionId and reportId in its metadata.

3. **Report Chunks**: For full debrief functionality, report chunks should be populated when the report is generated. This allows the debrief agent to search through specific sections of the report.

## Testing Steps

1. Complete a TMP assessment
2. Verify journey phase transitions to DEBRIEF
3. Navigate to the Reports page
4. Click on the completed TMP report
5. Verify:
   - Report content displays (or shows placeholder if generation fails)
   - Debrief chat is on the left side
   - Debrief agent has context about the completed assessment
   - Mock API shows assessment as "completed"
