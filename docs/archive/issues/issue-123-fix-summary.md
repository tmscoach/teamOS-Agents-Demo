# Issue #123 Fix Summary

## Problems Fixed

### 1. DebriefAgent Not Loading TMP Report ID 21989
**Root Cause**: User ID validation was rejecting database-generated CUID format
**Fix**: Updated regex in `/src/lib/mock-tms-api/services/report-context-service.ts` to accept CUID format:
```typescript
// Before:
if (!/^(user|facilitator|respondent)-[\d\w-]+$/.test(userId)) {

// After:
if (!/^((user|facilitator|respondent)-[\d\w-]+|c[a-z0-9]{20,})$/.test(userId)) {
```

### 2. DebriefAgent Cannot Search Knowledge Base
**Root Cause**: DebriefAgent was not being imported or registered in the chat route
**Fix**: Added DebriefAgent to `/app/api/agents/chat/route.ts`:
- Added import: `createDebriefAgent`
- Added to agent registration: `createDebriefAgent()`

### 3. Import Path Error in Guardrails
**Root Cause**: Dynamic import using `@/lib` alias was failing
**Fix**: Changed to relative import in `/src/lib/agents/guardrails/debrief-guardrails.ts`:
```typescript
// Before:
const { mockDataStore } = await import('@/lib/mock-tms-api/mock-data-store');

// After:
const { mockDataStore } = await import('../../mock-tms-api/mock-data-store');
```

## Verification

All fixes have been tested and verified:
1. ✅ User ID validation now accepts CUID format
2. ✅ Knowledge base tools are properly loaded in DebriefAgent
3. ✅ DebriefAgent is registered in both chat and streaming routes
4. ✅ Import paths are working correctly

## Test Results
- Knowledge base search returns results for "ICAF" queries
- DebriefAgent has 11 tools loaded (including 5 knowledge base tools)
- All integration tests pass

The DebriefAgent should now be able to:
- Load reports with database-generated user IDs
- Search the knowledge base for TMS terminology
- Answer questions about ICAF and other TMS concepts
