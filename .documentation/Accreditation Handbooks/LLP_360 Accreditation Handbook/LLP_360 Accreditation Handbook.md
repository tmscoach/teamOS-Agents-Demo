# <span id="page-4-0"></span>The TMS Story

Team Management Systems (TMS) was founded in 1985 by Dr Charles Margerison, a professor in management development at the University of Queensland, and Dr Dick McCann, a chemical engineer and international business consultant. With a shared fundamental passion to help people work better together, they launched a comprehensive worldwide research programme to answer the underlying question, "What makes teams successful?".

After collecting data from all types of industries, Drs Margerison and McCann set about to create a suite of valid and reliable tools that would provide individualised feedback designed to facilitate personal, team and organisational development.

With over two and a half million profiles completed worldwide, the work of Dr Margerison and Dr McCann has laid a foundation of unparalleled research that continues to be developed by the TMS team as they strive to 'ignite human potential worldwide'.

# LLP|360 Core Concepts

# <span id="page-13-0"></span>Leadership and 360-degree feedback What is Leadership

A simple definition of leadership is the process or ability to influence and inspire others towards achieving a common goal or mission.

Leadership is a dynamic and continuously evolving concept, with various theories and perspectives emerging over time. However, at its core, leadership is centred on relationships and the effective management and development of these relationships. It encompasses not just a title or role but a pattern of behaviour that involves aligning team members with the leader's vision, establishing clear expectations, and inspiring them towards accomplishing shared objectives.

At Team Management Systems, we believe leadership is about Linking — a set of competencies that enhance the coordination and integration of people to create a unified team that knows where it is going and how to get there.

## Importance of multi-rater profiles

The Linking Leader Profile (LLP|360) is a comprehensive multi-rater feedback tool designed to support skills development in leaders. It assesses a leader's competency in the 13 Linking Skills by collecting feedback from different groups of people, including direct reports, supervisors, and peers. This multirater data is combined with the leader's self-assessment to create a 360-degree profile that examines the leader's perceived performance, identifying the Linking Skills that are most important for the role. A 360-degree view of the perceived gap between what the leader should do and what they actually do is also generated, resulting in a secondary measure which highlights the overall satisfaction rate for each Linking Skill.

In addition to the data, the personalised LLP|360 report offers the leader targeted advice and strategies for improving their Linking Skills. The report includes an 'Activity Action Guide' which outlines activities that may enhance or detract from their leadership performance. With this valuable information, leaders can identify areas for improvement and take action to elevate their performance and drive positive change in their organisations.

# <span id="page-14-0"></span>Linking Skills Linking Leader Model

Early TMS research into high-performing teams identified eight tasks (referred to as 'Types of Work') that are critical to the success of any team. An additional ninth factor, 'Linking', was uncovered, which involves the coordination and integration of people and tasks within a team.

Linking lies at the centre of the Types of Work Wheel and represents a set of skills that any team member (referred to as a 'Linker') can contribute to a team's collective effort. Linking was further refined into the 'Linking Leader Model' which defines Linking Skills as a layered set of competencies that can be developed over time. The Linking Leader Model contains three levels of Linking Skills, which cumulatively influence outcomes such as team engagement, effectiveness, and discretionary effort.

As the 'ninth factor' in the Types of Work Wheel, Linking offers crucial support for projects and teams, enabling cohesive collaboration towards a common goal. However, if Linking Skills are not used well, a team can lose momentum and direction, potentially leading to a decline in performance.

# Levels of Linking – Overview

The Linking Leader Model identifies three levels of Linking:

- People Linking Skills
- Task Linking Skills
- Leadership Linking Skills

The three levels of Linking encompass a total of 13 Linking Skills: six in People Linking; five in Task Linking; and two in Leadership Linking. In an effective team, all team members need to contribute to the People Linking Skills level. However, those in leadership roles must successfully use the skills in all three levels.

![](_page_15_Figure_6.jpeg)

## Task Linking Skills

The middle level of the Linking Leader Model describes the Task Linking Skills. Task Linking includes five skills that relate to collective team tasks, relevant for those who are responsible for the performance of others.

Active Listening

![](_page_17_Figure_2.jpeg)

Quality

<sup>A</sup>ctiv<sup>e</sup> <sup>L</sup>isteni<sup>n</sup><sup>g</sup>

Active Listening goes beyond just 'listening' to others. It is about showing interest in what people say by asking questions, building on their statements and summarising what has been said. When done well, Active Listening is incredibly effective. It can often result in a dynamic two-way conversation that lets the speakers access a variety of perspectives and thinking, potentially resulting in highly productive discussions.

Active Listening requires those in the conversation to focus on the words being spoken without being distracted. While some people can naturally focus in this way, others might find their internal dialogue intrudes on that focus. Internal dialogue can prevent people from really listening to and comprehending what is being said in a conversation. To be an Active Listener, it is important that the listener clears their mind of internal dialogue so they can focus on what the other person is saying.

When a person is actively listening they are doing more than just taking in words. They also read the other person's tone, tempo, body movements and facial expressions. These non-verbal cues give valuable information about the speaker's thoughts and feelings on the issue being discussed. In the same way, the listener should cultivate physical body language that shows they are giving the speaker their full attention. This can positively affect the speaker's perceptions of how willing the listener is and, in turn, increase their willingness to share.

What people say to one another must match the way they say it. Listening with the body, getting involved with what they are saying and using non-verbal cues, such as nodding, shows understanding, reinforces ideas and opens deeper communication.

Finally, Active Listening is also about indicating to the other person that they have been heard and understood. Techniques such as asking relevant questions to clarify potential misunderstandings and summarising their thoughts can show the speaker that the listener has understood them. Ultimately, this encourages more profound and effective two-way discussions.

*To be an effective listener, clear the mind of all internal dialogue and focus attention on what the other person is saying.*

## Communication

To be good at Communication:

and keep others informed.

• facilitate group discussions well.

![](_page_18_Picture_1.jpeg)

An essential aspect of Linking is Communication, without it, there can be no teamwork. Communication helps team members understand what is happening in the team, and to be part of ongoing discussions and decisions about what will happen in the future. This allows them to feel like an essential part of the whole, which leads to more effective collaboration. On the other hand, when people are not updated about what is going on in their team, they may become demotivated. This can undermine a leader's other attempts to build a harmonious and effective team.

When it comes to Communication, people have different preferences and styles. Because of this, a team will need various communication techniques to interact effectively with each other. This is what we refer to as 'Pacing', and the ability to do this well is one of the key communication skills of Linkers.

Pacing requires empathising with another's perspective and engaging in communication that respects their preferences. Once rapport has been established and a certain level of trust generated, conversations can move into a free exchange of information where connection and understanding are created and maintained.

Being able to communicate effectively, supported by Pacing, allows a team to engage in dialogue that creates space for cooperation and collaboration.

> *Adjusting communication style to suit someone's preferences is called Pacing, which helps generate rapport and trust.*

## Team Relationships

![](_page_19_Figure_1.jpeg)

Harmonious Team Relationships are essential in a high-performing team. When there is a lack of respect, understanding and trust, there is no real team, only a group of people. However, when team members have strong Team Relationships, they will also have shared values and goals, a common purpose and the willingness to hold themselves mutually accountable while offering each other support, understanding and trust.

When there is diversity within a team, everyone must work hard to develop mutual respect. Recognising and celebrating people's differences can help foster good Team Relationships, as team members who understand the value of each other's skills and contributions are much more likely to develop respect and loyalty. Of course, when there is diversity, there can also be conflict.

Addressing conflict in a positive way can be a great source of creativity and innovation. In fact, the most innovative solutions can be created out of diversity, but only if harmonious Team Relationships are maintained. When team members understand each person's particular skills and contributions to a job, they are much more likely to value individual differences and much less likely to see them as a source of conflict.

Fostering a culture where a difference of opinion is encouraged creates an environment of open and authentic Communication.

*Leveraging diversity through strong Team Relationships is essential for high performance.*

Team members need to learn how to be available and responsive when other team members have a problem. Being responsive means showing a sincere interest in individuals and their challenges. It means being willing to take the time to listen, offer advice if asked, or give guidance if needed. Sometimes, just listening and showing interest is all that is required.

Developing good counselling skills is valuable when Linking with team members that may need support. Linkers will use a combination of effective Pacing and enquiring skills to get to the heart of an issue. Without discovering the root cause of any problem, it can be difficult to come up with an adequate solution.

When enquiring about a specific issue, some people like to be asked direct questions, while others prefer more open-ended questions. Some people like to concentrate on facts, while others like to focus on feelings. A good enquirer will quickly notice if their questions do not match the other person's preferences. When they see this, they will move to a different mode of enquiry that will allow them to uncover the important details of the problem.

Once team members can identify the heart of a problem, they can help find a solution. Together, they can 'reframe' problems into opportunities for growth. This reframing is a valuable skill that will inspire high performance in the individuals and the team as a whole.

> *Problem Solving & Counselling involves responding in a supportive and sincere way to team members' problems.*

## Participative Decision Making

![](_page_21_Picture_1.jpeg)

Sharing key problems and opportunities with team members builds trust. By doing this, the team become part-owners of the solution and will go that extra mile to make it work. Regardless of whose solution is ultimately chosen, inviting team members to voice their views early on paves the way for smooth and successful implementation.

With Participative Decision Making, it is important to strike the right balance of team participation. If every team member participates in all decisions, the team may spend all its time in meetings, stifling productivity. Instead, the key to balanced Participative Decision Making is identifying the specific areas where team member input is valuable, or there is a desire to be consulted. The most effective way to determine these areas is by engaging team members in open communication and discussion.

*A fundamental aspect of effective Participative Decision Making is establishing the key areas where team members wish to have input.*

## Interface Management

<sup>A</sup>ctiv<sup>e</sup> <sup>L</sup>isteni<sup>n</sup><sup>g</sup>

Interface Management is the process of managing the links between a team's members as well as other teams or key stakeholders. There are two important aspects of Interface Management – internal Linking and external Linking. Taken together, they build the lines of contact that create engagement, build trust and lead to high performance.

## *Internal Linking*

There needs to be high levels of interaction and communication if a team is to function well. Each person needs to know what the other is doing. Therefore, it is crucial to establish good information flows. Daily stand-ups – short, daily meetings where the team can discuss progress and challenges – are a good example of effective internal Linking.

## *External Linking*

The success of any one team will invariably depend on other teams within the organisation. These might be senior management, customers and even suppliers and competitors. External Linking is the proactive process that allows open lines of communication with these other stakeholders to ensure they understand what is being done and what is needed from them.

*Key tips to effective Interface Management are timeliness and relevance.*

# Task Linking Skills

Objectives Setting

![](_page_23_Figure_2.jpeg)

<sup>A</sup>ctiv<sup>e</sup> <sup>L</sup>isteni<sup>n</sup><sup>g</sup>

The expectations placed upon individuals can significantly influence their behaviour and performance. Where there are clear and achievable objectives for teams, the team is much more likely to demonstrate high-quality on-the-job performance. Where there are no clear expectations set or direction provided, or goals are constantly being changed, the team will tend to underperform.

Goals should encourage team members to stretch, but not to the extent of discouragement. Targets should be enough to pose a worthy challenge but not be so difficult that they seem too hard to tackle. Setting clear and achievable objectives allows team members to feel successful, boosting morale and motivation.

Involving team members in the objectives-setting process can also increase their sense of ownership and drive towards achieving set targets. Objectives should be clearly defined and results-focused, allowing the team to identify critical resources and measure success through performance indicators.

It is also essential to recognise and celebrate when the team achieves their objectives. This acknowledgment builds morale and ensures that the team is more likely to tackle the next challenge with enthusiasm and commitment.

> *Set clear and achievable objectives for the team and involve them in the process to drive towards success.*

Quality

Work

All teams should aim for excellence in their work, and Quality Standards play a vital part in determining the success of organisations.

Quality Standards are simply the guidelines, methods, systems and requirements followed by an organisation to ensure they are operating at a high level. Leaders can serve as role models for what is considered 'quality' within an organisation by setting high standards for their own behaviours and interactions. Their actions, whether they be a quick comment or a meticulously planned project, can set expectations for others to follow.

Quality Standards are not just 'set and forget'. They require ongoing review and analysis. Evaluations of client satisfaction can help improve the quality of products or services offered and should be undertaken on a regular basis. In addition, the team should continuously seek opportunities to enhance team members' skills, which will also lead to higher Quality Standards.

When working with individuals from a team, be mindful of criticism aimed solely at pointing out mistakes. This type of feedback can lead to fear of error and a tendency to hide them, which will undermine high performance. Instead, create a safe and supportive environment where mistakes are seen as opportunities for learning and improvement.

Together, the Linking Skills of Quality Standards and Objectives Setting are the cornerstones of the continuous improvement process. By working in tandem, they create a solid foundation in which individuals and team can achieve high performance.

> *By setting high standards through their behaviour and interactions, leaders can demonstrate the importance of quality and serve as role models for their team.*

## Work Allocation

![](_page_25_Figure_1.jpeg)

A leader's ability to allocate work effectively can help or hinder the team's potential to become high performers. Effective Work Allocation requires a well-thought-out approach that balances individual strengths, experiences, preferences and organisational and team goals. When there is a harmonious relationship between the tasks assigned and an individual's work preferences, they will feel more motivated and be more productive.

When it comes to Work Allocation, a leader might be tempted to make assignments based on team members' past experience. However, this can result in Work Allocation that does not align with an individual's preferences. When that happens, the team member can become demotivated and lose productivity, even if they may appear to be the best person for the job.

While it may seem ideal to align work entirely with someone's preferences, it may not always be practical or beneficial. The key is to find the right balance between catering to personal preferences and providing challenging work that offers opportunities for growth and development. Individuals who spend most of their time on tasks they enjoy are more likely to be willing to step outside their comfort zone for other tasks. Providing challenging work with adequate support and resources can lead to a more motivated and productive workforce.

It is crucial to schedule regular Work Allocation and team performance evaluations to ensure that leaders are assigning work in a way that aligns with their team's preferences while also broadening their perspectives. These are particularly important during changes in team composition or responsibilities.

*Effective Work Allocation balances the consideration of team members' preferences with the opportunities for development within an organisation's overall priorities.*

## Team Development

Quality

Work

<sup>A</sup>ctiv<sup>e</sup> <sup>L</sup>isteni<sup>n</sup><sup>g</sup>

To develop a high-performing team, leaders need to foster skills within the team to help members successfully perform their work functions. Part of this process is assessing work preferences within the team, particularly the eight Types of Work outlined in the Team Management Profile (TMP) framework. These are Advising, Innovating, Promoting, Developing, Organising, Producing, Inspecting and Maintaining.

Where work preferences are balanced, the team can function well, and the work lifecycle will be optimised. But where they are not balanced, for example, where too many team members prefer Advising to Producing, this could result in certain tasks receiving less attention. In addition, workflow as a whole will suffer.

Once the team identifies the gaps in work functions critical to their goals, they can create a tailored training and development plan to address these areas. A supportive culture that encourages team members to embrace new opportunities, gather information, and generate new ideas can contribute to the effectiveness of this approach.

Ultimately, a successful team focuses not only on their input (what they are working on) but also considers their output (what they produce) and the impact of their actions (what they influence).

> *Evaluate the team's preferences for the eight Types of Work to inform training and development priorities.*

## Delegation

![](_page_27_Figure_1.jpeg)

Delegation involves transferring work responsibilities by asking, 'Which activities can be completed by others?' Those tasks are then negotiated with team members available to take them on.

Successful Delegation requires providing the assigned team members with appropriate training and support. This allows those taking on the tasks to feel competent, and they will be able to demonstrate that competence in the work they produce. Accordingly, it is important to consider the necessary skills for successful task completion in order to build trust in team members' abilities and increase confidence in delegating tasks.

Finding the appropriate balance in Delegation is crucial. Being overly prescriptive can lead to micromanagement, which can be demotivating. On the other hand, having too much of a hands-off approach by failing to follow up on delegated tasks can result in confusion and inefficiencies.

In high-performing teams, Delegation may not be necessary. In those cases, team members will actively negotiate and allocate tasks among themselves autonomously and in a way that is the most efficient for the team as a whole.

# Leadership Linking Skills

To be proficient at Motivation:

Motivation

![](_page_28_Picture_2.jpeg)

• focus unwaveringly on all elements of a complex issue.

• articulate a compelling vision of the future.

• stand up for the team on controversial issues.

Effective Motivation involves more than simply persuading someone to carry out a task. It entails building relationships and engaging individuals in an endeavour that will continuously inspire their commitment and energy. In practice, Motivation is bringing out someone's best.

To bring out their best, leaders need to provide individuals with a clear picture of the future. This allows them to feel optimistic about where they are headed. Leaders with a compelling vision can effectively communicate it in a way that motivates others. These leaders firmly believe in the value of their aims and are willing to explain and defend them, even in the face of direct challenge. A vision of this kind is fuelled by a genuine desire to achieve, and it brings the vision to life for others, persuading them that the vision is worth pursuing.

The vision must also be translated into clear, achievable goals to act as beacons for the team to follow. Motivational leaders will focus unwaveringly on these goals, highlighting the connection to the team's work, goals and long-term vision. If there are no achievable goals, the team can quickly become demotivated.

Motivation is an individual experience. What motivates one person may not necessarily be inspiring to others. Skilled motivators tailor their Communication style to match the preferences of their team members. For instance, some may respond well to storytelling and metaphors, while others may find visual diagrams showing relationships more compelling.

Standing up for the team in controversial situations can also have a significant impact on Motivation. When team members feel that their leader is advocating for them, they are more likely to go above and beyond to support the leader's vision.

> *Effective Motivation requires leaders to inspire individuals and teams with a compelling vision, and adapting communication styles to match team preferences.*

## Strategy

![](_page_29_Figure_1.jpeg)

Strategy refers to the calculated and deliberate decisions that align with an organisation's long-term purpose. Effective leaders have a comprehensive understanding of the interconnections between various components within an organisation, that may not be immediately obvious to others. After all, no section, branch or team works in isolation.

When we zoom out to see the big picture to assess the impact of the rapidly changing external environment, we can adjust accordingly. When we zoom in, we can see the various impacts of the individual teams and even team members. This dual perspective helps leaders ensure that the outputs of individual units enhance the overall outcomes of the organisation.

The core of strategic planning involves having a clear and steadfast long-term vision, complemented by actionable plans that allow the achievement of short-term goals. This includes setting realistic timeframes that pave the way for the results to be achieved.

This requires leaders to stand back from the cut and thrust of daily life to examine the purpose of what they are doing; 'How do all the parts of the business interact to achieve the strategic plan?', 'What impact will external issues have on the organisation?', and 'How can we manage risk?' Leaders must anticipate potential roadblocks, critically evaluate their plans and make adjustments when necessary.

However, as accuracy in long-term planning is limited, strategic leaders must be flexible and ready to adapt to unexpected circumstances and changes. Effective leaders carefully separate the facts from their own assumptions when considering all the influencing factors. This requires a focus on long-term outcomes and the ability to respond creatively to setbacks, reprioritise goals, and continuously analyse and adjust their approach.

*Strategic planning involves having a clear long-term vision, actionable plans to achieve short-term goals and the flexibility to adapt to unexpected circumstances.*

# Measuring Linking Skills

Research highlights the difficulty we face when trying to accurately self-assess our own competencies. As such, Linking Skills proficiency is best assessed by those who regularly interact with the individual in question. For this reason, the LLP|360 was designed as a multi-rater questionnaire to allow an individual's Linking Skills to be rated by various people. This provides a more comprehensive Linking Skills assessment by comparing the self-rater's perceptions with those of others.

The Linking Leader Profile (LLP|360) Questionnaire consists of 78 items, comprising six items for each of the 13 Linking Skills. Leadership research clearly shows that while some competencies may be critical in certain roles, teams or organisational cultures, they can be of little importance in others. Accordingly, the questionnaire does not ask for a simple competence rating against each item. Instead, it implements a two-question assessment approach. Raters are asked to rate both the importance (Should occur) of the activity and its actual occurrence (Does occur) to determine the satisfaction rate for each skill, producing context-relevant feedback.

![](_page_30_Figure_6.jpeg)

LLP|360 Questionnaire raters are divided into a maximum of five different rater groups:

![](_page_30_Figure_8.jpeg)

To ensure a comprehensive assessment, we recommend the inclusion of at least five raters. These raters should have sufficient familiarity with the individual being assessed to confidently respond to at least two-thirds of the questionnaire items.

# Grouping of LLP|360 Questionnaire items

The LLP|360 Questionnaire is designed to evaluate an individual's Linking Skills through 13 distinct skill categories, each consisting of six assessment items. This approach provides a comprehensive evaluation of the individual's overall Linking skills as well as the option to delve into specific aspects for a more targeted evaluation.

# <span id="page-34-0"></span>Linking Leader Profile – Overview

The Linking Leader Profile (LLP|360) report is generated based on multi-rater responses to the 78-item questionnaire. In addition, accredited practitioners receive two additional resources: the Facilitator Report, which provides a summary of individual rater responses; and the General Comments Report, which compiles optional, anonymised, open-ended feedback from raters. Together, these three resources offer a holistic view of the leader's strengths and areas for development.

# LLP|360 report

The LLP|360 report is organised into six main sections which are collectively designed to provide the leader with an in-depth understanding of the feedback they have received. Each section provides a unique perspective to support the leader to identify their strengths and opportunities to further develop Linking Skills in their role.

## 1. Introduction to Linking Skills

This page presents an overview of the 13 Linking Skills and an explanation of how the LLP|360 Questionnaire is used to generate a personalised report for each individual.

## 2. Snapshot of Results by Group

This section of the profile provides a set of graphs which display the Linking Skills satisfaction and importance hierarchy for each of the rater groups. In each graph, the Linking Skill with the highest score appears at the top, with the remaining skills arranged in descending order beneath it. To facilitate easy cross-referencing, each Linking Skill is represented by a unique colour.

These graphs assist in determining strengths, focus areas and priorities. Linking Skills ranked higher in the Satisfaction Rate graph can be considered relative strengths, while those ranked lower can indicate focus areas. Similarly, Linking Skills ranked higher in the Importance Rating graph signify a higher priority, while those ranked lower suggest a lower priority level.

## 4. Results by Linking Skill - Narrative

This section of the profile offers an in-depth assessment of each Linking Skill. It includes the relevant Linking Skill graph from the Results by Linking Skills - Overview section. Additionally, it presents bullet points of advice that correspond to the six questionnaire items specific to that particular Linking Skill.

![](_page_37_Figure_2.jpeg)

Three different text variants are possible for each item.

- If all raters record a gap of one or less between what Should occur and what Does occur, then text is generated indicating that all raters seem pleased with the way this skill is being implemented.
- If the self-rater records a difference of one or less, while other raters record a gap of greater than one, then the text will focus on opportunities for further skill development.
- If the self-rater has a gap of greater than one, but all other raters have a gap of one or less, then text will be produced indicating that, while others seem content, the self-rater desires to do more. Possible reasons for this may include modesty or high personal standards.

Note that over-satisfaction will not generate any text unless the item is reverse-scored (items 34 and 40). For example, if the expected result is two and the actual result is four, this means that the individual is performing too much of this activity and may need to consider reallocating their efforts elsewhere.

When only one rater is present in a group, their actual responses to the questionnaire are displayed, while groups with multiple raters have scores represented by an average. The gap between the Should and Does scores for each group is displayed both numerically and visually, with the 'D' signifying what 'Does occur' and the 'S' signifying what 'Should occur'.

## 6. Activity Action Guide

This section presents a visual summary of the Guides for Action column represented in the Quantitative Report to support the development of a targeted action plan. The guide makes it easy to identify patterns of similarities and differences among the rater groups regarding recommendations for doing More (M) or Less (L) of an activity. A question mark (?) indicates the recommended action is uncertain, due to varying opinions among raters. The absence of a mark indicates satisfaction with the corresponding statement.

In addition to the main Linking Leader Profile (LLP|360) Report, two supplementary reports are provided to the accredited practitioner. The Facilitator Report is a confidential resource designed for practitioner use only, where the General Comments report can be shared with the leader at the discretion of the accredited practitioner. 90% 82% 88% 89% 92% 92% 94% 92% 75% 42% 100% 83% 75% 90% 82% 88% 89% 92% 92% 94% 92% 75% 42% 100% 83% 75% 83% 67% 100% 58% 38% 100% 63% 100% 50% 100% 46% 96% 100% 90% 82% 88% 89% 92% 92% 94% 92% 75% 42% 100% 83% 75%

The Facilitator Report is a resource generated for LLP|360 Accredited Practitioner use only. It offers a more in-depth analysis of the data to assist the practitioner in preparing for their debrief. The report presents each individual rater's perception of the leader's performance. The practitioner's discretion must be used as to whether this information is divulged to the leader, and to what extent. 83% 33% 42% 75% 25% 83% 83% 88% 100% 92% 44% 52% 79% 83% 33% 42% 75% 25% 83% 83% 88% 100% 92% 44% 52% 79% 83% 33% 42% 75% 25% 83% 83% 88% 100% 92% 44% 52% 79%

Expanding on insights gained from the Qualitative Report: Range of Opinion section, the Facilitator Report provides the practitioner with a more precise analysis of each rater's responses. Scores are averaged across the six items for each Linking Skill and displayed for both satisfaction and importance ratings. 79% 100% 100% 50% 100% 42% 50% 92% 75% 92% 79% 95% 96% 79% 100% 100% 50% 100% 42% 50% 92% 75% 92% 79% 95% 96% 79% 100% 100% 50% 100% 42% 50% 92% 75% 92% 79% 95% 96%

If a rater's satisfaction score is below average for that skill by 1 to 2 standard deviations, the data is bordered by an orange outline. If the score is well below average (i.e. by more than two standard deviations), the outline is red, highlighting the perceived areas for improvement on a rater-by-rater basis. A normal range is indicated by a black outline. 27% 63% 60% 81% 56% 56% 67% 79% 71% 65% 46% 67% 82% 90% 60% 83% 42% 92% 38% 67% 79% 63% 71% 92% 100% 88% 27% 63% 60% 81% 56% 56% 67% 79% 71% 65% 46% 67% 82% 90% 60% 83% 42% 92% 38% 67% 79% 63% 71% 92% 100% 88% 27% 63% 60% 81% 56% 56% 67% 79% 71% 65% 46% 67% 82% 90% 60% 83% 42% 92% 38% 67% 79% 63% 71% 92% 100% 88%

## General Comments Report

The General Comments Report includes feedback about the leader's performance provided by raters from a final question within the questionnaire:

![](_page_41_Figure_2.jpeg)

To maintain rater anonymity, comments are not linked to individual raters or groups and will only be generated where at least two raters have responded. The accredited practitioner may choose whether to share the comments with the leader at their discretion.

The LLP|360 algorithm assigns a numerical score to each rater response. 'Not at all' is assigned a score of zero and, 'To a very great extent' is assigned a score of four.

| Scoring responses |                       |                   |                      |                           |  |  |  |  |
|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|--|--|--|--|
| Not<br>at all     | To a little<br>extent | To some<br>extent | To a<br>great extent | To a very<br>great extent |  |  |  |  |
| 0                 | 1                     | 2                 | 3                    | 4                         |  |  |  |  |

However, the scoring is switched for reverse-worded items in the questionnaire (e.g., Item 40, 'Interrupts others instead of listening'). If the rater were to select the 'Not at all' response in a reverseworded item, it would be assigned a score of four instead of zero.

# Satisfaction rates

Satisfaction rates are determined by the variance between rater scores for Should occur and Does occur.

For example, consider the scores assigned for each of the questionnaire items for Active Listening (see table below). For Item 1, the rater indicated that the leader should listen well when others are speaking to a great extent (3) but does listen when others are speaking to a little extent (1). The gap between the two scores is then expressed as a fraction and represented as a percentage, which in this case would be 33%.

Note the satisfaction rate calculation is switched for reverse-worded items (e.g., Item 40). In this case, the score of 'Not at all' is assigned a score of four instead of zero.

|           |                                                              |                   |                 | Satisfaction rate |              |  |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|--|

| 1         | Listens well when others are speaking                        | 3                 | 1               | 1/3               | 33%          |  |

| 68        | Engenders a good two-way discussion of issues                | 4                 | 3               | 3/4               | 75%          |  |
|           | Overall satisfaction rate for Active Listening               |                   |                 |                   | 73%          |  |

\* Reverse-worded item

Table 1. Sample questionnaire items for Active Listening

When calculating satisfaction rates, the smallest value always sits on top of the fraction, even when the score for does is higher than the score for should. For example, examine Items 27 and 47 in Table 1. The score of 2 for should and the score of 3 for does in Item 27 works out to two-thirds (or a 66% satisfaction rate). This same satisfaction rate of 66% is also obtained for Item 47 where the score for should is 3 and the score for does is 2.

$$
\frac{\text{Should}}{\text{Does}} \frac{2}{3} = 66\%
$$

Satisfaction rate calculation for Item 27 from Table 1

Should Does 2 <sup>3</sup> = 66%

Satisfaction rate calculation for Item 47 from Table 1

This is because the calculation of satisfaction rates is based on the variance between the raters' assessment of the leader's desired performance (Should occur) versus their actual performance (Does occur). Raters may be indicating that they want the leader to be investing less of their time and energy into these activities than they currently are.

Rater satisfaction percentages are averaged across the six items corresponding to that particular Linking Skill. If a rater group comprises more than one rater, the average satisfaction rate is calculated across the rates provided by all raters in the group. See the example below to understand how the Active Listening satisfaction rate is calculated for a group of three raters, by aggregating and averaging their individual scores.

Satisfaction rate calculation for a group with more than one rater

## Importance ratings

Importance ratings are determined by the 'Should occur' responses in the questionnaire. The score for each Linking Skill is expressed as a percentage for each rater group, with a score of 100% being the highest possible score.

Similar to the satisfaction rate, where there is more than one rater in a group, the importance ratings are averaged to produce an importance rating for the whole group.

## The concept of Linking was developed from empirical studies in the 1980s by Drs. Charles Margerison and Dick McCann during their research to define work functions. Several activities that correlated strongly to form a variable that was eventually defined as 'Linking' were placed at the centre of the Types of Work Wheel to indicate their shared relationship with the eight Types of Work. Linking was later defined as a set of behaviours that coordinate and integrate teamwork, initially divided into People Linking Skills and Task Linking Skills. In 2002, the model was extended to include the Leadership Linking Skills of Motivation and Strategy.

The LLP|360 Questionnaire was designed as a multi-rater feedback tool, recognising that leadership competencies may vary in importance based on the organisation, culture and type of leadership role. It uses a two-question approach, allowing the assessment to measure gaps against a varying benchmark.

Further information on the following areas can be found in the Linking Skills Profile Research Manual (5th Edition):

- The relationship of the Linking Leader Model to leadership theories
- An evaluation of the psychometric validity and reliability of the LLP|360
- Ongoing validation studies

# Linking Skills Profile Executive Summary

The LLP|360 maintains a high level of psychometric validity and reliability due to many years of rigorous testing prior to commercial release, as well as the ongoing work of the Institute of Team Management Studies.

While the research manual addresses the more in-depth aspects of the LLP|360, the executive summary answers many questions that clients may ask. Enquiries concerning instrument development, validity and reliability and normative data can all be found in the executive summary. This is a useful resource to send to a prospective client or someone who needs more detail on the profile's rigour and research components.

# Reliability

Psychometric scales are measured by a number of items that define each scale. A reliable scale must have an adequate degree of internal consistency, which can be measured using a statistic known as the Cronbach alpha coefficient. In general, an ideal range is 0.75–0.85.

The table below shows the Cronbach alpha coefficient for the 78 questionnaire items grouped into their 13 component subscales for both Column A (to what extent should this activity occur) and Column B (to what extent does this activity occur).

# Validity

Validity relates to whether the instrument measures what the authors claim it measures, namely, skills from the Linking Leader Model. While reliability addresses how consistent and accurate the measures are over time and across different contexts, validity looks at how 'meaningful' the scores are.

## *Face validity and utility*

Face validity is the extent to which a scale or group of scales 'makes sense' to observers and test users. Utility refers to the usefulness of an instrument, an important concept in the field of management, team and organisational development (as rater feedback is expected to lead to tangible performance improvement). High face validity and utility were generated through an iterative process, with input from many focus groups over a number of years leading to modifications and refinement.

## *Structural validity*

Structural validity refers to the degree to which the scores of an instrument are an adequate reflection of the construct being measured. The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient is used to determine the extent to which variables are 'proportional' to each other. Intercorrelation calculations between the 13 subscales confirm the presence of a single scale – an overall measure of Linking. Further confirmation of this is indicated by a factor analysis of the 13 subscales (Table 3). This data shows the existence of a single scale on both Column A (to what extent should this activity occur) and Column B (to what extent does this activity occur).

## *Construct validity*

Construct validity refers to the relationship between the LLP|360 Questionnaire and other validated theoretical concepts. By studying these relationships, researchers gain a better understanding of the scale's true meaning. If the instrument accurately measures the intended construct and does not measure unrelated concepts, it demonstrates strong construct validity.

The Linking Leader Profile (LLP|360) has wide-ranging applications and benefits for any leader, team, or organisation. By incorporating the LLP|360 into professional development programs and capability initiatives, organisations can enjoy its benefits across all levels. The following

![](_page_51_Figure_3.jpeg)

# <span id="page-52-0"></span>Interpreting the profile

When preparing for a debrief, begin by identifying the main themes and focus areas in the leader's LLP|360 report. This will assist the leader to craft an action plan that produces impactful results for both the individual and the organisation as a whole. To keep outcomes achievable, TMS generally recommends that the leader is supported to identify three strengths and up to three focus areas for development.

Start by identifying any strengths or opportunities for improvement for each Linking Skill. Compare how different rater groups have scored the satisfaction and importance of these skills. Next, determine which of the six items for each of the identified Linking Skills need to be developed. Finally, use these selected items to support the formulation of a detailed development plan.

During each debrief, specific needs may arise, and there is no fixed rule about which section of the report to examine first. The decision will depend on the leader's objectives or interests. As a general guideline, we recommend starting with high-level views, such as 'Snapshot of Results by Group' and 'Results by Linking Skills – Overview'.

# Review Linking Skills

## Compare Linking Skills *within* a rater group

The Snapshot of Results by Group section helps to identify the satisfaction and importance of each rater group. We recommend that leaders start by reviewing their self-rated scores and then look at the ratings from the other groups.

![](_page_53_Figure_3.jpeg)

then repeat the process for each rater group. To identify strengths, first look at the top three Linking Skills in the Satisfaction Rate column, then cross-check for matches with the top three Linking Skills in the Importance Rating column. Team Development Communication Quality Standards Work Allocation Strategy Objectives Setting 83 81 77 76 Participative Decision Making Motivation Strategy Team Relationships 95 94 93

Any Linking Skill that appears in the top three of both the Satisfaction Rate and Importance Rating columns can be viewed as a strength. Any Linking Skill that has a high satisfaction rate, regardless of its position in the Importance Rating column, can also be viewed as positive feedback. We suggest that a leader's debrief always begins with positive feedback by having a conversation about these strengths.

Once strengths have been identified, the leader can be supported to identify their areas for improvement. Start by comparing the bottom three Linking Skills in the Satisfaction Rate column with the top three in the Importance Rating column for each rater group. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Group B Satisfaction Rate

On the other hand, they have identified the Linking Skills of Strategy and Team Development as potential areas for improvement by rating them in the bottom three in terms of satisfaction, and in the highest three in terms of importance. This type of analysis helps identify both strengths and opportunities for improvement. Mike Jones 5 © Bellcastle Pty Ltd T/A Team Management Systems, 2023, Queensland

## Compare Linking Skills in general

RESULTS BY LINKING SKILL - NARRATIVE Use the Results by Linking Skill - Overview section to see which Linking Skills were scored the highest and lowest. These summary graphs may help the leader identify which skills raters are generally satisfied with and which ones they are the least satisfied with. An example of this process is set out in the images below:

#### RESULTS BY LINKING SKILL - NARRATIVE Leadership Linking Skills *Strategy* The word 'excellence' is now a frequently used word in modern management. Teams that strive for excellence are those Some of the most significant mistakes in teamwork arise as a consequence of failure to share information. This is essential if others are to do their jobs effectively. You could benefit from 'taking stock' of how well you share important

STRATEGY • Skills rated 'moderately' (51% - 75%), represented by the visual key may be considered as areas for development if there are no Linking Skills rated at or below 50%. that will sooner or later deliver outstanding results. If everyone in the team has a belief that 'only the best will do' then excellence becomes part of the team's culture. It could be worth discussing with your team members to what extent excellence should be a part of the common or shared values in the team. Then it is up to you to set the example for information with other members of your team. Rather than trying to solve problems on your own, try involving others at an early stage.

Another way for the leader to identify which items to focus on for each Linking Skill is to go to the Activity Action Guide section. For each Linking Skill that the leader identifies as a focus area, they can look for the 'M' (do more of this activity) and 'L' (do less of this activity).

# Develop a plan

Start by exploring how any identified strengths might be leveraged to improve performance. Then use the Results by Linking Skill - Narrative section to drill into the details of each Linking Skill that has been identified as an area of focus. Up to six bullet points of advice are provided for each Linking Skill, corresponding to the six items related to that skill in the questionnaire. These suggestions offer practical strategies for a leader to incorporate into their action plan. Note that an over-satisfaction rating for an item will not generate any bullet points of information.

# <span id="page-59-0"></span>Case Study: Warren House Recyclables

This case study will help you to understand how to interpret and prepare for an LLP|360 debrief, including how to interpret insights and develop suggested actions.

## Background

Eighteen months ago, Mike Jones took over as the new Production Manager for Warren House Recyclables, Australia's leading manufacturer of crates made from recycled plastic. The company's recent focus on sustainable products had led to positive growth, with turnover doubling in the two years prior.

When Mike became the Production Manager, he inherited a team of managers (Direct Reports) accustomed to working long hours to meet production targets. During the past couple of years, new competitors were emerging, and many were offering cheaper alternative forms of packaging. Because of this, the pace of work at Warren House Recyclables has recently started to level off.

These changes in the work environment led to some new challenges within the team which need to be addressed. Mike feels that current working practices should be re-evaluated and new ideas introduced. The team also needs to be more involved in key customer relationships and product development.

To help address these issues, Mike was invited by the Human Resources Director to complete an LLP|360 review in order to seek feedback from his Supervisor, Peer, and Direct Reports.

## Rater Selection

As the self-rater, Mike invited feedback from his:

Supervisor – Operations Director

Direct Reports (GROUP A) – four of the managers (reporting to Mike)

Peer (GROUP B) – Logistics Manager

No Independent Raters (GROUP C) were selected for this assessment

An extract from the Warren House Recyclables Organisational Chart shows the raters and their respective rater groups:

Mike is ambitious and aspires to be a Managing Director one day. His colleagues on the management team respect his drive and strategic focus. However, a couple of his team members have said that they felt "left in the dark" by some of his decisions. He spends much of his time in project and management meetings.

*Jazmin*

Jazmin has been with the company from the beginning, 17 years. She has a master's degree in chemical engineering and manages a small team. Jazmin is quiet and thorough in her approach to work.

## Insights and suggested actions for the Warren House Recyclables Case Study

## Key insights

- With strong customer demand, the team has worked hard to achieve it's organisational goals.
- The team may need to focus more on responding to customer needs, optimising processes and driving innovation.
- The rater groups have varying priorities. For example, Mike seems eager to build a connected, strategic production leadership team. On the other hand, his supervisor places more emphasis on outputs and 'getting on with the job'.
- The team overall is highly experienced, qualified and wants to be involved in driving team decisions.

## Strengths and development areas

## Debrief tips

The accredited practitioner delivering Mike's debrief should:

- Avoid trying to explain all the data in one session. Start with identifying Mike's strengths before moving on to development areas. Discuss his self-rated scores, then his Supervisor's ratings before focussing on the Direct Report rater group.
- Advise Mike that change in one area is likely to impact other areas. For example, if he addresses Participative Decision Making, he may well find Communication, and Team Relationships are positively impacted.
- Help Mike understand why there may be a large difference between rater groups, for example, his Supervisor rates Delegation at 92% satisfaction, whereas his team rates it at 40% satisfaction. This Linking Skill will have more impact on Mike's team, where they value autonomy over their work assignments.
- Confirm with Mike which Linking Skills will be the focus areas and then use the Quantitative Report and Activity Action Guide to determine which of the six items for those Linking Skills require development.
- Ensure Mike creates a development plan that clearly outlines his goals. To avoid overload, suggest Mike initially targets three areas to work on. The development plan should ideally address some of the items from Participative Decision Making, Delegation, Team Relationships (identified by Mike and the team) and Strategy (identified by Mike and his supervisor). These areas are high importance and low satisfaction.
- Help Mike log insights and actions in the Linking Skills Action Planning Guide section of the Linking Leader Profile Workbook.

## Follow-up activities

The accredited practitioner delivering Mike's debrief should:

- Suggest that Mike respond to each rater to thank them for their feedback.
- Encourage Mike to run a session with his Direct Reports, and one with his Supervisor, sharing key insights and any actions he will take. This is an effective way for Mike to show he is committed to professional development.
- Schedule ongoing coaching session to support Mike with his development plan.

# <span id="page-65-0"></span>Guide to Programme Delivery

Once you have identified a need for the Linking Leader Profile (LLP|360), it is time to get planning!

Follow this guide for tips on how to deliver your programme successfully. When delivering debrief sessions, it is important to consider the circumstances and choose the most effective approach. Individual debriefs provide an opportunity for the leader to ask questions and create a personalised action plan with your guidance. However, running group feedback sessions can also yield great rewards. To be successful, there needs to be a high level of trust and professional maturity within the group, which allows participants to feel psychologically safe and comfortable expressing their vulnerabilities. Creating a safe environment for group feedback requires careful attention to the needs of each participant, as well as clear guidelines and ground rules for communication.

Whether it be an individual debrief or a group facilitation workshop, there are three main stages to programme delivery.

![](_page_65_Picture_6.jpeg)

Before you deliver your programme, it is essential that you complete the following activities.

![](_page_65_Picture_8.jpeg)

*with the client*

A LLP|360 programme should be designed to improve the performance of the leader(s) and their team(s) within the context of the organisation's strategic objectives. It is, therefore, critical to identify the business objectives behind the programme initiative. Placing professional development at the centre of a broader strategic context can also help people accept the process without feeling targeted or singled out for improvement or appraisal.

Gather information to define the scope, clarify expectations and design your programme. You may like to ask questions about the programme's purpose, previous exposure to psychometric profiles and the desired return on investment.

Key points that should be addressed at this stage of the process:

- Confirm that the organisational culture will support the introduction of 360° feedback. Ensure there is senior management commitment, as this has a key influence on whether 360° feedback is seen as credible within the organisation.
- Identify a specific business objective or problem.
- Explain that the focus of this instrument is on constructive feedback to help people improve their Linking Skills and, subsequently, their performance as managers and leaders.

## *with the leader and other raters*

## Select raters to complete questionnaire

The leader will ideally be involved in identifying who is best positioned to evaluate their performance. The number of raters is important as the feedback needs to include a large enough sample to ensure that it is valid. If it is too small, there is a risk that a single rater could significantly influence the resulting report.

A minimum of five raters is recommended, including:

- Self-rater
- Supervisor
- Three direct reports (Group A)

While the leader may be tempted to select only three raters with whom they have a personal relationship, this approach could result in inaccurate feedback on their Linking Skills. It is recommended that all peers and direct reports be invited to participate in the process, provided they have a sufficient level of familiarity with the leader to answer at least two-thirds of the questionnaire items accurately.

## Introduce the programme

This part of the process involves preparing raters to complete the LLP|360 Questionnaire. All raters need to complete the questionnaire in an honest and considered way and it is crucial that they understand the purpose and significance of the report and how it will be used. Use the 'LLP|360 Instructions and Email Templates' to assist with your communication.

You need to:

- be aware of past history and usage of leadership questionnaires within the organisation.
- outline the business objectives behind the application.
- clarify whose ratings will be identifiable. This occurs when there just one rater in the group, such as the supervisor.
- emphasise the importance of providing honest answers.
- describe the process of completing the questionnaire.

## Send out the questionnaires

With the programme now introduced, raters can be invited to complete the questionnaire. To guarantee a smooth experience process, TMS will provide administrative support and guidance throughout this stage.

To ensure the success of the programme, it is important to carefully consider the logistical requirements involved. This includes allocating sufficient time to gather and analyse the data. Having the reports generated a few days before the debrief is advisable, as this gives you time to read the results and prepare constructive feedback. Before feeding back the profile content, ensure you have read the report thoroughly and have extracted the key points. Reflect on how you will relate the results back to the key concepts underlying the Linking Leader Model.

When giving feedback, it is essential to plan ahead and choose an approach that will be situationally effective. By tailoring your feedback approach, you can increase the likelihood that feedback will be well-received and lead to positive outcomes. For individual debriefs, it is helpful to consider the leader's communication preferences and choose a feedback style that aligns with them. For team debriefs, choose a style that promotes positive communication within the group. Creating an environment conducive to constructive feedback makes participants more comfortable sharing their thoughts and ideas, which can lead to improved teamwork and better outcomes.

## Deliver your programme

You have arrived at the stage of delivering your well-planned programme! Your debrief can be conducted with the leader individually or as a group; in person or virtually. Whatever the delivery scenario, the basic process is:

Outline

*the business objectives*

Remind the leader of the objectives that were communicated during the initial consultation with the client and leader. These objectives might include enhancing leadership skills, improving communication and collaboration within the team, identifying areas for development and growth, and aligning individual goals with those of the organisation.

Explain the LLP|360 can help leaders achieve these objectives by providing valuable insights into their strengths and areas for improvement in key work competencies related to People Linking, Task Linking, and Leadership Linking Skills. Through the process of raters who have provided honest and constructive feedback, leaders can obtain meaningful insights. This feedback can serve as a starting point for discussing key leadership skills and help leaders identify their top priorities.

![](_page_68_Picture_0.jpeg)

Explain that the model is based on extensive research on high-performing teams and identifies core skills that integrate and coordinate teamwork. Provide an overview of the three levels of Linking: People, Task, and Leadership. Explain that by using this framework, leaders will gain a deeper understanding of these skills and how they can enhance team performance.

![](_page_68_Figure_2.jpeg)

To facilitate a better understanding of the profile, explain how to read and interpret the various sections. When working with individuals, you may consider sharing their profile report immediately. However, when working with a group, it is helpful to begin by sharing a sample profile report and explaining the different sections. This will ensure that participants understand how to read and interpret their own reports.

Once you are confident that participants understand the report's structure, you can distribute their profiles. It is important to be familiar with the content of each report, as it will inform the conversations you will have with each participant. By understanding their strengths and areas for development, you can ask the right questions and help them to set goals that will enhance their leadership skills.

Allow plenty of time for participants to read and absorb the information and encourage them to reflect and discuss the insights gained.

Develop

No matter how much interest and discussion the profiles generate, the process must always converge on development opportunities. Remember, 360° feedback is simply information. Having a tangible outcome of the process is essential. This can be encapsulated in a leadership development plan, allowing the leader to choose the kind of development strategy they want to adopt based on the feedback they have received.

You should ensure that action plans are aligned with business objectives, within the person's control and are measurable. Finally, build in a date for review so that progress can be tracked and amendments to the plan can be made in the light of new feedback (if needed).

![](_page_69_Picture_10.jpeg)

## Follow Up

Follow-up is crucial for ensuring that the action plan is effective and that programme participants are committed to improvement. A clear, concise, and targeted post debrief programme can help you engage with participating leaders and ensure they have the opportunity to apply their insights back in the workplace.

Engage

*with your leader*

After completing a session, send a clear summary of the objectives and actions from the programme in a follow-up email. This will create alignment with the agreed next steps, clarify what needs to be done and create a shared commitment.

![](_page_69_Figure_16.jpeg)

The initial debrief marks the beginning of their journey towards self-discovery and high performance, but to achieve their goals, they will need to schedule additional sessions.

Additionally, it is essential for the leader to engage with their raters, providing feedback on what they have learned and to thank them for their input. It is important they communicate what specific changes or improvements they plan to implement based on the feedback received.

![](_page_69_Figure_19.jpeg)

If possible, a second set of LLP|360 Questionnaires can be completed six to 18 months after the initial questionnaire to measure the improvement over a suitable elapsed time. Additionally, this data can help you to evaluate the development programme in terms of return on investment.

# TMS Ethical Guidelines

The purpose for these Ethical Guidelines is to promote high standards of personal integrity, including the responsible handling of respondent profiles and interactions with respondents.

While the Ethical Guidelines do not, and cannot, deal with every situation that may arise, the principles provide a basis for honest and ethical decision-making and dealings. Failure to comply with these Ethical Guidelines could result in withdrawal of the accreditation status.

- Part A is for administrators and accredited practitioners.
- Part B is for accredited practitioners only who are subject to further ethical obligations.

These Ethical Guidelines relate to both single and multi-rater TMS profiles. A reference to 'respondent' and 'profile' should be interpreted in both the singular and plural. A 'respondent' is someone who has completed the TMS profile questionnaire and receives the resulting profile. An 'administrator' is someone who manages and is responsible for profile processing on behalf of an accredited practitioner. An 'accredited practitioner' is someone who has completed an authorised TMS accreditation and whose status is recognised by TMS as current.

## Part A – Administrators and Accredited Practitioners

Each person must:

- 1. Act with integrity and observe the highest ethical standards of business conduct in their dealings with TMS' customers, respondents and anyone else with whom they have contact in association with TMS, its products or its services.
- 2. Avoid conflicts of interest, comply with all applicable laws and regulations and uphold privacy and maintain confidentiality.
- 3. Only use profiles, associated materials and concepts and models, in a professional manner, showing due care and skill, and attention to the needs of the respondent.
- 4. Not access a respondent's profile without authority to do so, nor share a respondent's profile with people other than the respondent without the respondent's permission. Note that a respondent's profile is the personal property of the respondent and may contain personal information.
- 5. Not use a profile (or its contents) as the sole criteria for recruitment, selection or placement; or to label or evaluate the respondent. Profiles, labels and concepts associated with respondent results must not be used in a judgemental manner.

## Part B – Accredited Practitioners

In addition to Part A, accredited practitioners must, in addition to their obligations as set out in other TMS policies and codes:

- 6. Provide a debrief to every respondent including an overview of their profile and associated concepts and models from an authorised source, including any TMS Accredited Practitioner.
- 7. Inform respondents of the purpose of completing a profile questionnaire, and that it is voluntary.
- 8. Provide accurate and non-judgemental information to the respondent about the meaning of their profile results with a focus on development.
- 9. Regularly engage in continuing practicing education and training and keep their knowledge and skills up to date.
