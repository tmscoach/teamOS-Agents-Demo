THEORY AND RESEARCH


HOW MUCH RESEARCH WENT INTO THIS?


Two Australians, Dr Charles Margerison and Dr Dick McCann, developed Team Management Systems. Margerison

and McCann researched the Team Management Systems models and instruments for over five years before the

Team Management Profile Questionnaire (TMPQ) was commercially released in 1985.


Furthermore, there is a separate research arm of Team Management Systems, the Institute of Team Management

Studies, that is committed to the ongoing research of TMS around the world, ensuring the highest levels of

reliability and validity of all TMS products. The TMPQ has been approved by the British Psychological Society (BPS)

as a valid and reliable occupational instrument.


HOW DOES THE BRITISH PSYCHOLOGY SOCIETY CONSIDER THE TMP?


The BPS places the TMP in the ‘Personality’ category of psychometric instruments and concluded that,


“… the Team Management Profile has a high face validity with managers, the narrative profile is easy to read and
understand, and the information feedback guidance is excellent … The instrument has a wide range of
applications: career counselling, training and personal development, project management, team building, and so

on.”


The high level of psychometric validity and reliability of all of the TMS instruments is attributed to many years of
rigorous testing prior to commercial release, as well as the ongoing work of the Institute of Team Management
Studies (ITMS).


Strictly speaking, our questionnaires are considered 'tests' and they do fall under the category of personality (as

opposed to occupational or ability/performance). The British Psychological Society, a key industry body that has

conducted an independent assessment of our products and research, files our review under the category of

Personality Test.


Although our products do fall under the personality test category, **we do not refer to them in this way**, to ensure

our messaging about the intent and design of our products is clear (ie. it is a market positioning decision).


HOW IS THE TMP QUESTIONNAIRE VALIDATED?


There are three different ways questionnaires of this type are validated.

More details are available in the Accreditation Manual. page 91.


WHAT IS THE ORIGIN OF THE COLOURS OF THE TEAM MANAGEMENT WHEEL?


When sunlight is passed through a prism, the white light disperses into the colours of the spectrum: from red

through orange, yellow, green and blue to violet. This physics theory was adapted to the Team Management

Wheel, where the colours of the wheel meet in the white Linking centre. The roles complement each other and

together make a whole team. Working and Linking together unites the colours into white light. There are four

main colours:


**Fresh Green:** Colour psychology suggests green is often associated with feelings of renewal, ambition and

growth. The green section of the Team Management Wheel signifies the beginning stages of the development

process, involving new ideas, learning and gathering information.


**Bright Yellow:** Yellow is the brightest colour of the visible spectrum, often associated with the sun. The colour

signifies high energy and cheerfulness, regularly used in marketing to promote optimism and creativity. When the

sun is out, we feel energised and ready to explore the world, which is why this colour spectrum was chosen to

represent the promoting aspects of teamwork.


**Warm Red:** The colour red has established a universal meaning, representing action, energy and danger. This

colour spectrum was chosen to represent the Organising section of the wheel where heat and action are

generated within a team.


**Deep Blue:** Following the conclusion of an activity comes the ‘cool off’ period. Blue is often associated with

feelings of control and clear thinking. This part of the wheel represents a period of reflection and evaluation

within the team.


**White Linking Light:** When sunlight is passed through a prism the white light disperses into the colours of the

spectrum. This physics theory was adapted to the Team Management Wheel: as the roles in the wheel come

together in the white linking centre it signifies a balanced team.

WORK PREFERENCES


HOW IS THE TMP WORK PREFERENCE DISTRIBUTION CALCULATED?


Work preference distribution data shows to what degree an individual prefers to work in each of the eight areas

of the Types of Work Wheel, based on their responses to the Team Management Profile Questionnaire.


Probability scores are calculated by distributing one hundred percentage points across all eight Types of Work to

indicate the tasks the respondent likes best and least. Promoting. Inspecting, Maintaining and Advising are the

least preferred tasks.


This section helps the respondent understand their preference levels for Types of Work outside their major and

related roles. It’s important to note that these preferences do not necessarily reflect the effort or level of

performance that the individual puts into each Type of Work.


Work preference distribution data is derived from calculating a percentage for each sector of the 16-fold Model

based on the Four Work Preference Measures (RIDO). Preferences of inner and outer sectors are combined to

determine a percentage for each Type of Work.


The workplace preference distribution % data are based on the raw scores for each questionnaire items. If your

net scores are low, then your percentage distribution will indicate that you are relatively comfortable working on

any task. If your net scores are high the percentage distribution will vary significantly, indicating a high preference

for some Types of Work and a low preference for others.


**More advanced explanation:** The probability score is calculated for all eight ends of the scales. So if someone has

net scores of E30 P30 A30 S30, then the probability for the Organising TOW sector would be Pr(EPAS) + Pr(ICAS)

ie. 1+0 = 1 or 100% in percentile value. All the other 8 sectors would have zero. More common would be raw

scores of less than 30 on all of the 8 measures (E,I,P,C,A,B,S,F). So that means that the probability scores would

be positive for all eight sectors but the sum of all the probabilities would add up to 1. In general the probability of,

for example, the Creator-Innovator sector would be (PrE x PrC x PrB x PrF) + (PrI x PrC x PrA x PrF).


DOES YOUR JOB INFLUENCE YOUR WORK PREFERENCES?


Behaviour is very much influenced by job requirements and the expectations of others – driven by the prevailing

culture. Rewards are often given to those who mirror characteristics demonstrated by senior management, which

reinforces cultural influence. This external influence may modify behaviour, and, over time, this modified

behaviour will have a slow feedback on work preferences.


There may be problems when the organisational expectations are substantially different to an individual's work

preference and those who experience significant difficulty may well look for another job. Those who remain will

often change their work preferences to align with organisational expectations.


ARE MY PREFERENCES THE SAME AT HOME AND AT WORK?


Some people do have similar work preferences at home and at work whereas others have different preferences.

For example, we have met many people who like being extroverted at work as that is the best way they can


7


achieve their goals. However, at home they prefer to be more introverted as they wind down to “recharge their

batteries”. Likewise, people may be more introverted at work, particularly if the job demands high levels of

individual skills such as accountancy or information technology. At home though, they enjoy the balance they

create by being more outgoing and involved with social activities.


Interestingly, a TMS study of 99 managers showed 44% who rated themselves as Structured at work, preferred a

more Flexible orientation outside of work. Similarly, 38% of Analytical decision-makers rated themselves as more

Beliefs-oriented outside of work. 25% of Extroverts said they preferred a more Introverted approach in the non
work environment.


WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STYLES, PREFERENCES, BEHAVIOURS AND PERSONALITY?


**Style** is an overarching umbrella term. An individual’s working style will include **preferences** as a subset, which

contributes to their style at work. In other words, when referring to a team member in general, we may use the

term _style_, but when referring to a team member's TMP specifically, we use the term 'preference'. If we are

looking for interchangeable words to preference, we can also say what someone enjoys or likes to do at work.


Preferences and **behaviours** are closely related but distinctly different concepts. They are the “yin and yang”, or

opposite sides of the same coin. Preferences are the inward, subjective likes; that often drive our behaviour and

decision making. On the hand, behaviours are the outward, observable actions which may reflect our

preferences.


Preferences are an integral part of the TMS brand, specifically, the TMP preferences at work, whilst we don't tend

to use the term “behaviour” when referring specifically to our concepts.


**Personality** is not used within the context of TMP, as it implies a locked-in trait, regardless of being at work or

home, or over time. (MBTI is more likely to refer to personality, but TMP never does).


There is a correlation between preferences and **skills** (remember the four Ps!), but they are not interchangeable

terms. If somebody has a preference for a Type of Work, they are _more likely_ to be proficient (skilled) at that

Type of Work, but we can never assume this.


ARE THE EIGHT TYPES OF WORK WHEEL FUNCTIONS IMPORTANT IN EVERY JOB?


In any job there may be several different activities that need to be carried out, but some of these activities can be

performed by virtually anybody with the requisite qualifications. Whilst all the Types of Work functions need to

be collectively covered by a team if it is to perform effectively, in every job there are just a few activities that are

critical. These critical activities require people with particular abilities and preferences, and they make the

difference between good and poor performance in the job.


For most jobs, we have found the critical activities typically cover two or three sectors of the Types of Work

Wheel. For example, some jobs have an emphasis on Producing and Inspecting, whereas others are more

oriented to Innovating and Promoting.


Although all jobs are likely to contain all elements of the Types of Work Wheel, only some of these functions are

_critical_ . **An understanding of these critical elements is important if job performance is to be improved.**


8


WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RELATED ROLES?


In addition to your major role preference, two related roles will be shown in your personal Team Management

Profile. These are the areas of the wheel where you also have preferences. Your profile will indicate how your

preferences will change to those of your related roles in certain situations.


The related roles are calculated according to your scores on each of the Four Work Preference Measures. Many

people will be allocated related roles on either side of their major role. It is easy to see how people can, on

occasion, prefer to operate in these adjacent sectors of the wheel.


However, it is also possible to have a Skewed Wheel where the two related roles are on one side of the major

role. Also, a Split Wheel is possible where the related roles are nonadjacent to the major role. These variations

around the wheel simply reflect different approaches to work.


IN SIMPLE TERMS, WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE 8-FOLD AND 16-FOLD MODELS?


The 16-fold model goes deeper into understanding role preferences by dividing them into inner and outer

segments, according to their RIDO scores. These segments share the same role preference but differ in how they

like to approach this Type of Work.


The 8-fold model is a simpler way to look at role preferences and is a good starting point. However, the 16-fold

may be useful to explore how respondents that share a mixture of inner and outer wheel combinations for the

same role preference can better link with each other. For example, with a group of Explorer-Promoters, delve

into how the respondents with outer wheel role preferences (ECAF) may like to approach tasks differently to

those with inner wheel role preferences (ECBS).


In the above example, two people both with a preference for Promoting work will differ in the way they go about

that work. They both have preferences for Extroversion and a Creative way of how they gather and use

information. The first person will have more of an analytical way of making decisions, and a more flexible

approach to organising. The second person will make decisions based on beliefs, and a more structured approach

to organising. These differences should be taken into consideration when they pace with each other.


More information on the 16-fold model, including applications, can be found on pages 66-69 of the TMP

Accreditation Handbook in the Facilitator Resources.

MY PROFILE


HOW ACCURATE IS MY PERSONAL TEAM MANAGEMENT PROFILE?


In most cases we would expect a profile to be over 85% correct, based upon the extensive research we have

carried out. Therefore there may be some aspects of your profile which you may question or with which you may

disagree. The important point to note is that the Profile is intended as a tool which will help you identify your

strengths and enable you to assign your priorities. While your profile highlights the key points of importance to

you in the work situation, the specific emphasis and weight attached to each issue is best judged by yourself.


A confirmatory face validity study was conducted in 2009 with an international sampling of TMS network

members. Results from this study confirmed mean face validity greater than 91% for all the profile reports

(n=109,843).


The Team Management Profile (TMP) indicates your work preferences. If you think about the rule of 4P's, we all

tend to _practice_ what we _prefer_, become more _proficient_ doing it which makes it more _pleasurable_ . Therefore, if

you are a Creator-Innovator, the theory says the Innovating function is one you prefer, so you will probably tend

to do more of it. Through practice, you will become better at performing this function.


This does not mean you are unable to perform the other work functions well – it simply means more energy may

be required. Conversely, you might love working within the Innovating function, but may not perform

exceptionally well in that space.


WHY ARE MY TMP SCORES DIFFERENT FROM THE ONES I GOT 12 MONTHS AGO?


Work preferences are dynamic and, to varying degrees, could change depending on circumstances. We see

evidence of this when scores change as people move into new roles.


If a net score is undifferentiated (e.g. Beliefs preference net score of ‘2’), it is more likely the TMP will change, as

it would only take a slight difference in the questionnaire response to move the net score over to the other side

of the scale.


However, some people have clear preferences for all four work preference measures, making their scores less

likely to change. Due to the tool's sensitivity, even if the major and related roles remain the same, the work

preference raw and net scores may alter, still providing valuable insights for the respondent.


Worth mentioning is the ‘reliability of the instrument’. Here, we look at the ‘test-retest’ reliability of the TMP

Questionnaire. By testing people and then comparing their scores after a few years, TMS has established that the

TMP Questionnaire has strong reliability. For instance, 64% of participants returned the same overall profile after

six years.


10


HOW OFTEN SHOULD I DO A TMP?


We suggest there is value in completing a new TMP at least every two to three years.


WHAT DOES A SPLIT WHEEL MEAN?


A Split Wheel means that you have work preferences in non-adjacent sectors of the wheel. Typically, people have

preference for similar sorts of work. In Split Wheels, people like to work in different areas. Common examples are

ICAF (Creator-Innovator), ICAS (Thruster-Organiser), and IPAF (Controller-Inspector). This may indicate that the

individual likes to come up with new ideas or ways of doing things, enjoys seeking order and structure, and

making things happen.


Individuals with a Split Wheel are often quite versatile and can more easily flex around the wheel. They may also

find it easy to see and approach situations from different viewpoints. Conversely, they may also find it difficult to

focus, experiencing internal conflict about where they want to spend their time.


HOW DOES THE TMS SOFTWARE SELECT A MAJOR ROLE WHEN I HAVE A ZERO NET SCORE?


Consider this example: Net scores of E:9 P:3 A/B:0 S:12.


In the case where a net score is zero, the TMS algorithm decides which combination to choose as the major role

(EPAS - a Thruster-Organiser or EPBS - a Concluder-Producer).


There are four key questions in the Team Management Profile Questionnaire which our research shows measure

each of the Four Work Preference Measures the most reliably, these are questions 50-53. The TMS software uses

these 'tie-breaker' questions when a respondent has a zero net score. These are shown below, along with the

constructs they correspond to in brackets.


50. Talkative - Quiet (Extrovert - Introvert)


51. Unplanned - Planned (Flexible - Structured)


52. Feelings - Analysis (Beliefs - Analytical)


53. Creative - Practical (Creative - Practical)


The TMS software first looks at which of these items has a zero score - in our case the A-B scale, as measured by

question 52. The respondent has a choice of responding using the 2-0 or 2-1 preference.


In the case above, if the respondent identified a higher preference on item 52 for the Beliefs option, the major

role would be EPBS Concluder-Producer. Whereas, if the respondent gave the higher score to the Analytical

option, the major role would be EPAS Thruster-Organiser.


11


If the participant has a zero net score on any of the four work preference measures, it's a good idea to show them

the hard copy Team Management Profile Questionnaire, questions 50-53 and explain that we use these tie
breaker questions to calculate the major role when respondents have a zero net score.


Further information available in the Accreditation Handbook, page 87


The Work Preference Distribution determines the probability of preference for working in each of the eight

sectors of the Types of Work Wheel. This information is calculated from the net scores on the four work

preference measures. If the percentages don’t add-up to 100% this is a rounding effect as the scores are rounded

to the nearest whole number.


The short answer is that we need to simplify things and, through rounding, we have worked out which is your

major and related roles. That is, although the scores might be tied, if we were to take into account the decimal

point, one of the Types of Work (i.e. your major role or reported related roles) would be higher.


For example, a respondent may have a tied score of 22% for Organising and 22% for Producing, and their Major

role is Thruster-Organiser. In this case, Organising may have been 22.3% and Producing 21.9%.


12


MY TEAM


IF WE'RE AN UNBALANCED TEAM, IS THIS A BAD THING?


We have worked with a team comprised entirely of Concluder-Producers who thought that they would be

assumed to be poor-performing because they were so _unbalanced_ . Interestingly, this team was one of the best

achievers in the organisation. They were superb at reaching any target that was set for them and were pretty

much a model team. The way that they did this was by making sure they took the time to listen to their clients,

find out what the best methods were for what they were doing, taking time to look at how they were doing things

and if it was the best it could be. What they were doing was paying attention to the work functions outside their

preference areas.


Being unbalanced is not necessarily a bad thing, in the same way, being balanced isn't automatically a good thing.

If all members of a team plot into one area of the Team Management Wheel, all it means is that they should

spend some time reviewing their process to ensure that all Types of Work are being covered. The next step is to

agree on what action needs to be taken to plug the gaps in process.


IS IT BETTER FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ALIKE TO WORK TOGETHER?


It is probable that people who have similar interests will often prefer to work together. We know from research

that certain jobs tend to attract particular kinds of people. For example, practical information-gatherers do tend

to look for jobs that require a high degree of operational work. Creative information-gatherers, on the other

hand, will tend to seek out jobs where they can exercise their ideas and innovations, such as in research and

advertising. People who like detailed work will be more likely to look for jobs where they can exercise such

preferences, for example in quality control or accountancy. Others with a more extroverted preference will

search out jobs where there is a high degree of interaction with others, such as in sales and other promotional

activities.


If too many people with the same preferences work together, an unbalanced team could result, unless an effort is

made to focus on those role preferences on the other side of the wheel.


HOW WILL LEVERAGING TMS TOOLS MAKE US A BETTER TEAM?


There are a few ways that using the Team Management Systems (TMS) tools, can help with your team dynamics.

Firstly, you will find that by getting a better understanding of everyone’s preferences, you will know more about

the strengths and the differences that everyone brings to the team.


Secondly, TMS helps your team analyse the way you work so that you can develop action plans to ensure you

focus on work functions that are critical to successful teamwork.


Thirdly, your team will have a common language to discuss not only individual differences but to talk about the

work activities everyone does. The initial workshop can be considered as the first stage of what should be an

ongoing process of improving the way a team works.


13


FACILITATOR


MY TEAM IS SCEPTICAL ABOUT THE TMP. WHAT CAN I DO TO GET THE TOOL OVER THE LINE?


**Uncover the source**


When it comes to team development in the workplace, scepticism often occurs because people have had poor

experiences in the past and don’t want to waste their time again. Start by asking them where their scepticism

comes from. If it has to do with a past experience, take the time understand more specifically about that

experience. What made it bad and how is the TMP different from it.


If their previous experience had a low relevance to their work situation, ask them questions about their current

pain points with their team and show them how the TMP will address those issues directly.


Often the scepticism occurs simply because they have a lack of information about the process and what’s

involved. In this case it might be an opportunity to walk through the agenda for the session and what’s expected

of everyone. You could show them the three diagnostic tools (Pacing, Job Match and My Team – all found on

TMS Global) that have been created to enhance the TMP learning experience.


If their scepticism relates to psychological assessments in general, then providing specific information related to

TMS and the TMP could help make them feel more comfortable. Ensure that they are aware that the information

is kept confidential and isn’t going to be used as a tool to marginalise anyone, it does the opposite as it embraces

diversity and inclusivity.


**Address the pain points**


Start by asking the leader questions related to their current team environment so they can see that the TMP will

directly address their work challenges and enhance how the team works together.


  - How would you describe the communication within the team? Does everyone feel included?

  - Are there aspects of the work that are not done as well as you’d like, or as often as you’d like? (For

example auditing, innovating, selling ideas etc)

  - How well is your team set up for success for the work that needs to be done?

  - How well are your team members suited to the work they are doing?

  - How engaged is the team?


Using questions like these will help team leaders connect the value of the TMP tool and TMS process with the

positive impact it will have on their team. The TMP is a great tool to set your teams up for success - to build and

maintain a cohesive team environment, create awareness of self and others, and apply that info to better connect

with your colleagues to enhance results.


As you know from using the TMP, it’s easy to facilitate a process where the team themselves works out how to

capitalise on its strengths and minimise blind spots. By providing useful information presented in simple visual

models, the team can take charge of its own development in a way that they own the result.


**About TMS and the TMP**


14


Depending on how the individual likes to make decisions, it can also be useful to share some quick facts about the

TMP:


  - The TMP is based on 38 years of global research into high performing teams

  - TMS is internationally recognised as the specialist in teamwork

  - The TMP has been translated into 20 languages, there are over 24,000 accredited practitioners globally,

who have used over 2 million profiles

  - The TMP has been favourably reviewed by the British Psychological Society as a valid and reliable

workplace tool

  - The TMP is used by leading global organisations such as BHP, Qantas, NAB, Deloitte, Thiess, ExxonMobil,

Johnson & Johnson, IBM, Siemens, and Boeing


WHAT IF SOMEONE DOESN’T AGREE WITH THE PROFILE OUTCOME?


**Talk it through**


If someone feels their TMP doesn’t reflect their way of working, it’s important to let them talk it through. What

were they expecting? Which part of the report do they agree with/not agree with? It is helpful for them to go

through those parts of the report with a trusted colleague. Does that trusted colleague agree with the report?

This is to determine whether these parts of the profile are a potential ‘blind-spot’.


If someone disagrees with large sections of their Profile, sources of bias that you might check include:


  - Were they considering their work role or career, as opposed to a 'whole of life' perspective? In varying

degrees, some people are different when they're at work compared to when they're with their friends or

family.

  - Did they answer in terms of how they like to work as opposed to how they think they're expected to

work? The TMP reports in terms of work preferences and if you are required to work in areas outside

these preferences, the feedback will probably lack face validity.

  - Has the respondent experienced any significant life-event recently? Changes in lifestyle (either positive or

negative) may affect how accurate the Profile seems.

  - The report may not seem a reasonable assessment from the respondent's perspective, but what do their

colleagues think? Perhaps the respondent's self-awareness is skewed.

  - Usually your first response to an item is the most accurate. Did the client answer the profile questionnaire

quickly, or did they spend time vacillating over their responses?


**Establish the face validity of the TMP**


Face validity refers to how accurate the profile is to the respondent. This is critical, as you can have the most valid

and reliable instrument but if the face validity is low people will reject it.


It may be helpful to ask learners, “On a scale of 1 – 10 (1 being least accurate, 10 most accurate), how accurate is

your TMP?”. Usually the group will say 8 to 10. Which is high face validity, as preferences are hard to measure

due to multiple variables.


15


If someone feels their TMP doesn’t reflect their way of working, let them talk it through. What were they

expecting? Which part of the report do they agree with/not agree with? Were their scores high or low on the

Work Preference Measure? It's also useful to ask them “What would your colleagues say? / How do others see

you?” (often, colleagues agree with the profile and the item in question is actually a ‘blind-spot).


**Ticks and Crosses**


Ask the participant to place an ‘X’ next to any statements in their profile that they don’t agree with or they feel

does not accurately describe them.


Then ask them to give the profile to someone they trust, who will then write an ‘X’ next to the participant’s ‘X’, if

they also agree that the statement doesn’t accurately describe the profile owner.


When you do this exercise, typically you don’t see too many ‘XX’, which is a nice illustration of the high face

validity of the TMP. Where the profile owner has written an ‘X’ and the colleague agrees with the profile, the

profile owner has gained an insight into a blind spot.


In the rare case where the respondent and colleague concur that the statement does not seem accurate, this

might be explained based on the strength of the client’s scores. That is, if they have undifferentiated net scores (5

or below), it would be very likely that some parts of their feedback may not resonate strongly.


**TMP Questionnaire Administration**


If after this, they still feel the report doesn't accurately describe them, it's a good idea to go back to the original

set up of the process. Perhaps the person hasn’t read instructions? Did they answer in terms of how ‘they _like_ to

work as opposed to how they think they’re _expected_ to work’ (they should be encouraged to focus on how they

like to work).


**Net Scores**


You will also want to check your client’s net scores. This will help clarify the comparative difference between their

major role and first related role. For example, if someone’s net scores were I:15 P/C: 0 A:21 F:22, their major role

may be identified as a Controller-Inspector or Creator-Innovator, depending on their response to item 53. In this

case, let’s assume they were identified as a Controller-Inspector. As borderline as it is, it may be that text doesn’t

quite seem to fit as well as it might have done if the respondent had received a Creator-Innovator profile.


If after all this, the person still feels the TMP isn’t accurate, you could have them complete another TMPQ. If

you’d like to do this, please let us know.

Example of email response:


  Confirm they have answered the questionnaire accurately


`o` Most people have, but it is crucial they have answered the questions according to their

preferences at work, not their preferences at home or what they think their workplace
expects of them.

  Face Validity

`o` For a psychometric profile to be consider reliable, it needs to score >80% face validity 
the percentage of the report that resonates with the respondent. Our research indicates
a 91.6% face validity. Which means that the report may not necessarily align 100% with
the individual. We encourage respondents to go through the report and highlight the
parts they strongly resonate with and mark the parts that surpised them. There can be
various reasons for this, some of them are mentioned below, but they can also check
these comments with a trusted colleague to confirm whether that part of the report does
not resonate with them, or it could be a blind spot for the individual.
`o` If you would like to know more about face validty, you can go to pages 6 and 852 of the

Reasearch Manual, available for download from the Facilitator Resources.

  Inner Wheel major role, Split Wheels and Undifferentiated scores

`o` It is important to look at a persons report in context. For instance undifferentiated scores

(5 or less) will indicate the person is more able to flex to either side of the scale.
`o` Matt presents with an Inner Wheel Controller-Inspector major role, with a Split Wheel,

suggesting he can flex between preferences more readily than others.
`o` To read more about this, download the Digital Handbook for Facilitator Resources and

refer to pages 69, 78 and 82.

  Work preference distribution percentages

`o` Instead of putting too much weight to the percentage scores, it is more important to pay

attention to the RIDO scores, major and related roles. You may like to view these as
ranking, rather than absolute scores. In other words, what are the top three, what are the
bottom three and see if they resonate with the individual.
`o` There is a useful activity in the TMP Personal Discovery Workbook on page 4 - 'Personal

Snapshot' - this will ask them to rate their effectiveness and enjoyment levels of the eight
Types of Work- which can a good conversation starter.


WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TMP MANAGERIAL AND TEAM MEMBER REPORT?


There are two different versions of the TMP report – Managerial and Team Member. They are very similar, but

the Leadership Strengths section is titled Individual Strengths in the Team Member report. Additionally, the

language is simplified in the Team Member report.


HOW DO I DEBRIEF A TEAM SKEWED TOWARDS ANALYTICAL?


People with a more analytical approach will favour information that is more objective and measurable. They will

prefer facts and hard evidence.


17


In the workshop, be adaptable to their identified needs. Sometimes you come into a workshop and their needs

are different to what you have anticipated – e.g. they prefer to focus on Linking according to their Four Work

Preference Measures, as opposed to addressing gaps in their major role.


You could ask questions around their level of scepticism, and where they are specifically sceptical. Answering

their questions with evidence around the validity of the questionnaire will help them.


  - **Face validity** is the extent to which a scale or group of scales “makes sense” to observers and test users.

Margerison and McCann aimed to have at least 80% of the TMP deemed “correct” by the recipient. A

confirmatory face validity study was conducted in 2009 with an international sampling of TMS network

members. Results from this study confirmed mean face validity greater than 91% for all the Profile

reports (n=109,843).

  - **Structural validity** is a form of validity that relates to the development of models or their scales and

subscales – for the TMP that relates to the relationship between the four work preference scales (E-I, P-C,

A-B, S-F) and the Types of Work Wheel. The initial development sample was not large (n=275); however,

two additional analyses were undertaken to examine the characteristics of the scales (n=623, and n=170)

and the results were consistent across all three studies.

  - **Construct validity** measures the extent to which a test or scale relates to other theoretical concepts,

which have proved by other studies to be valid. The TMP has been compared with 10 other related

questionnaires confirming that it does in fact measure what it claims to measure.


More details are available in the Accreditation Manual. page 91.


If they need reassurance and positive encouragement, refer to the Worldwide Norm Data image (page 23 of the

Personal Discovery Workbook), as they are quite reflective of this major role distribution.


The approach outlined in the Advanced Report User Guide (5 pages) will be handy, especially the suggested

questions and facilitator tips.


In general, it’s preferable if you draw out the answers from them by asking questions. Once they identify their

own improvement areas, build the need by asking what would happen (impact) if they didn’t address these gaps.


The first part of the TMP Team Action Plan is likely to be more relevant for them; if so, focus on that.


The Types of Work review questions can


Example of be used once they work out which areas they need to address (attached for your convenience)


There are a number of activities in Team Debrief Slide Deck, specifically for the Information scale

(Practical/Creative):


  - Design a pool complex (in slide deck)

  - Ask the right questions (in slide deck)

  - Step into RIDO

  - Effective Decision Making according to RIDO

AFTER THE TMP DEBRIEF, WHAT SHOULD I DO NEXT TO MOVE FROM INSIGHT TO ACTION?


We typically find teams really engage with their TMP. However, if nothing concrete happens, the following are

**three** next steps to embed learning and move from insight to action. These are all available at

[https://tms.global/Facilitator/Resources.](https://tms.global/Facilitator/Resources)


1. Gain instant performance feedback and develop a Team Action Plan with **My Team Diagnostic**

**2.** Build better relationships with our **Pacing Diagnostic**

**3.** Build rapport with the **Our Team in 3-2-1**


**My Team Diagnostic**


My Team Diagnostic is a 28-item questionnaire based on the Types of Work Wheel. Each person fills out My

Team individually and receives a **My Team** report showing % satisfaction rates and narrative advice for each Type

of Work and Linking.


This report is one person’s data. You can run a one- hour session to aggregate the data and get a team view with

the worksheet.


1. Have each person complete My Team. Ask them to print or save a copy and bring it along.

2. Run a face-to-face session – we recommend 1 hour. Purpose: to review and fine-tune teamwork.

3. Aggregate team’s results onto the poster

4. Use the worksheet to have each person:


      - Log their scores for each Types of Work

      - Get average % for each Types of Work

      - Choose the 3 Types of Work with the lowest %

      - Identify 1 or 2 actions to improve these Types of Work


My Team is our favourite tool for team reviews. Teams can deep-dive into what is working, and improvements

needed in a short session.


**Pacing Diagnostic**


One of the main benefits of the TMP is to use the profile information to better connect and communicate with

others. You can use the **Pacing Diagnostic** to help people develop better working relationships.


1. Have each person log into their respondent site on TMS Global.

2. Click on Pacing Diagnostic.

3. Select a person you would like to communicate more effectively with, then watches the video presented


by Dr Dick McCann. Select which RIDO constructs e.g. Extrovert or Introvert, which best describes them.

4. You will receive a 1-page Pacing Summary which includes your role preference, as well as the person they


rated plus tips for better Linking and potential areas for conflict and how to minimise these. This helps

team members plan the best way of interacting with their colleague and helps them build rapport.


**Our Team in 3-2-1**


19


Complete the **Our Team in 3-2-1** document. Save the file somewhere central for easy access, and have each

person type in their TMP highlights **.** Refer to this document before team interactions / meetings to adapt your

style to best communicate with your colleague/s.


DOES TMS OFFER REFRESHER COURSES FOR ACCREDITED PRACTITIONERS?


Once you are accredited with any of the TMS products you have a lifetime membership with no ongoing

membership fees. Our support continues and your accreditation is transferable across regions.


However, TMS does encourage accredited practitioners to stay current as our tools and materials are regularly

updated and currency can diminish if the tools are not being used.


If a practitioner would like a refresher on any of our four products TMS offers an accreditation update which

includes a hardcopy kit (including handbook and mini magnetic wheel set) and access to an online learning

module which covers the underpinning theory (of the TMP). Refresher course costs $395 ex GST and requires

approximately 3 hours of learning investment.


If a practitioner would prefer to attend a full accreditation workshop - a one-day virtual session which focuses on

application design and debrief - this is also an option. For this we offer a discounted rate to accredited

practitioners $995 ex GST.

NORM DATA AND TECHNICAL ENQUIRIES


HOW CAN I USE THE NORM DATA IN MY WORKSHOPS?


Please find attached the Research Manual 5 [th] edition, with several useful articles that speak to the norm data.


A summary of each article is outlined below:


**TMPQ Worldwide Database Sample Breakdown** (p. 60): This article highlights that while the worldwide sample is

predominately UK, US and AU, also included are SE Asia, the Caribbean, Middle East, Europe and other regions.

This article shows the distribution of major roles based on the 16-Fold model.


**TMPQ Worldwide Database Functional Area Analysis** (p. 74): Shows the distributions of major roles in various

functional areas e.g. sales, finance, administration, and then goes on to look at each TMS major role and which

functional area they would most likely be found. For example, 15% of Explorer-Promoters in our sample are found

in consulting.


**TMPQ Worldwide Database Industry Analysis** (p. 113): As above, but this time for industry. Shows the mean

score along RIDO for various industries, as well as the representation of major roles. The sort of interesting

snippets you’ll find here are insights like the fact that construction/building have the highest mean scores for

Structure.


**TMPQ Worldwide Database Profession Analysis** (p. 83) **:** As above, but this time for professions e.g. economists,

scientists, psychologists etc. Interesting points of note from the data are explained first (e.g. teachers and

psychologists record a high % of Reporter-Advisers - 10% against the global norm of 3%); and this is followed by

data for each group.


**TMPQ Validity, TMPQ Reliability** (p. 30, 40) **:** Both articles go through two main aspects of research: reliability and

validity.


**TMPQ Development** (p. 19) **:** Discusses the strategies and methodologies around the development of the TMP. A

good companion reading to the Validity and Reliability papers.


*NOTE: either attach the ‘Research Manual’ or refer them to the _facilitator resources_ section of the TMS Global

website


DO WE HAVE NORM DATA FOR BOARDS OF DIRECTORS?


We do not have specific norm data for boards of directors, as we do not include that category in our questions to

respondents. At the end of the questionnaire, we ask respondents about the following categories: Profession,

Country, Organisational level & Functional area.


The closest sample in our current norm data that may be relevant is the Worldwide Organisational Levels: Top

Manager/Leader (page 51). It is interesting to note some of the differences with this sample compared to the

total worldwide sample (page 1). For instance, there is a shift in median Extroverted preference from two to


21


eight; and a change in the Information median from Practical: 2, to Creative:1, leading to a higher representation

of Explorer-Promoters and Assessor-Developers.


WHY DON’T THE TMP MAJOR ROLE PREFERENCE DISTRIBUTIONS ADD UP TO 100%?


The short answer to this is related to rounding errors and the number of decimal places displayed. A more

detailed explanation follows below.


**Rounding errors:**


This is an unfortunate issue but one that occurs when applying a rounding cut-off point. For data integrity this

must be consistently applied across all MRPs. All eight roles are rounded up using the same measuring point to

two decimal places and it has been, and needs to remain, consistent across all research manuals and reporting.


**Less than 1% representations:**


To put these into perspective, these occurred 20 times out of 2304 percentages in this analysis set so it is not

common. In terms of rounding these up, please be assured that these have all already been rounded up before

being represented as 0.x%. They cannot be rounded up further to 1% as this would destroy the integrity of the

data to say that potentially two MRPs are equal when in actual fact, for example, one is 1% and the other is 0.4%.

Equally to say that there is 0% when there are actually representations would also destroy the integrity of the

current data and also contradict previous analysis sets.


22


**Decimal places:**


We don't go to one or two decimal places on the MRPs for a number of reasons that have consistently shown up

and been proven repeatedly over the years:


a) This doesn't eliminate rounding errors.

b) This is a level of complexity that many don't want for the purposes of training and comparisons which in


turn gives rise to incorrect and inconsistent rounding by individuals modifying the data as everyone

chooses their own cut-off point(s) and how they are applied.

c) Due to the previous point, this puts variants of the same MRPs out for distribution within and across TMS


teams as well as facilitators and research documents.


The only time we report in decimal places is on the 16 Fold Model for this reason and it is only done for the

worldwide sample in the research manuals or on specific organisation/facilitator sample request.


23


INCLUSIVITY AND DIVERSITY


HOW DOES THE TMP WORK WITH NEURODIVERGENCE?


While the Team Management Profile (TMP) is designed to enhance communication, collaboration, and

performance by recognising and valuing individual work preferences, it's important to note that we have not

specifically researched its validity and utility in the context of neurodiversity. As such, we refrain from making

general statements about its application and impact in these cases.


Neurodiversity encompasses a wide spectrum, with each person’s individual experience being unique.

Personalised discussions are essential to ascertain if the TMP can be a constructive tool for a neurodiverse

individual, ensuring they understand its purpose, methodology and how the information will be used. If desired

and where appropriate, individuals may benefit from having a supporter present during the questionnaire to

facilitate the process.


Our commitment is to foster inclusive cultures, honour diverse contributions, and ensure a psychologically safe

environment for all participants. If the TMP does not meet the needs or resonate with the perspective a

neurodivergent individual, we are not only open discussing alternative approaches but also prepared to refund

the cost of the TMP in these instances to ensure satisfaction and value for all.


IS THE TMP VALID WITH FIRST NATIONS PEOPLE?


In terms of demographics, our data collection is primarily organised by country, organisation level and industry.

We do not specifically capture data for Indigenous populations within those countries.


Regarding the differentiation between responses of First Nations and other groups, we have conducted some

preliminary analysis and have noticed differences in certain cases. However, it is important to note that our

research has primarily focused on establishing general validity in a workplace environment, rather than

specifically investigating minority groups.


While our psychometric tool provides general validity and has been used across various cultures, including some

comparisons involving Asian cultures, we have not conducted extensive research on Indigenous populations or

specific cultural groups outside of the Western context.


We recognise the limitations of our current approach and are open to working with interested parties to explore

these areas further.


WHAT STEPS WOULD BE INVOLVED TO VALIDATE THE TMP WITH FIRST NATIONS PEOPLE?


Validating a psychometric tool to ensure its appropriateness and cultural congruence with specific populations is

crucial for accurate and meaningful assessment. Here are some considerations for addressing the validity of a

psychometric tool for a First Nations group:


  - **Cultural Adaptation:** Begin by acknowledging the unique cultural context and values of the First Nations

group in question. Collaborate with community members, elders, cultural experts, and relevant


24


stakeholders to ensure that the tool is adapted and aligned with their specific cultural norms, beliefs, and

experiences.

  - **Consultation and Collaboration:** Engage in extensive consultation and collaboration with members of the

First Nations community throughout the development and validation process. Involve them in decision
making, item selection, and linguistic adaptations to ensure cultural relevance and sensitivity.

  - **Linguistic Appropriateness:** Pay careful attention to the language used in the tool. Ensure that it is

appropriate, respectful, and inclusive of the linguistic nuances and dialects specific to the First Nations

group. Collaborate with language experts within the community to ensure accurate translations and

interpretations.

  - **Content Validity:** Conduct a thorough review of the tool's content to assess its relevance and

appropriateness for the specific cultural context. Ensure that the concepts, items, and response options

are meaningful and aligned with the cultural experiences and worldview of the First Nations group.

  - **Pilot Testing:** Conduct pilot testing of the adapted tool within the First Nations community. This allows for

feedback and input from community members to further refine and validate the instrument. Pay

attention to response patterns, item comprehension, and any cultural biases that may arise.

  - **Concurrent and Construct Validity:** Evaluate the psychometric properties of the adapted tool by

comparing its scores with established measures that are culturally appropriate and widely accepted

within the First Nations context. This helps establish concurrent and construct validity by demonstrating

the tool's ability to measure the intended constructs accurately.

  - **Continuous Evaluation:** Establish a process for ongoing evaluation and refinement of the psychometric

tool. Regularly seek feedback from the First Nations community to ensure that the tool remains culturally

congruent and continues to capture the unique experiences and perspectives of the group.


It is important to note that the process of validating a psychometric tool for a specific cultural group requires

collaboration, time, and resources. It should be approached with cultural humility, respect, and a commitment to

ethical research practices.

SALES QUESTIONS


I’VE USED OTHER FEEDBACK INSTRUMENTS - WHAT’S DIFFERENT ABOUT TMP?


The Team Management Profile (TMP) differs from other profiling tools, in that it is based on a unique

understanding of what makes a high performing team – **considering both what we like to do and how we**

**approach work** . The research that underpins the TMP considers, not only the activities that are required for

sustained high performance (what we call Types of Work), but also analyses the impact individual preferences

have on how individuals approach work, communicate and build relationships.


The TMP helps to describe workplace behaviour and can help leaders to improve organisational effectiveness

through building awareness into work processes. The personalised report provides individuals with an

understanding of their preferences and key insights into how they can improve interaction at work.


A workshop using the TMP will help provide an understanding of what drives team behaviour. Whilst the

individual profiles focus on maximising potential and engagement in one’s own work, the combined team data

illustrates team strengths, preferences and potential blind spots. That is, tasks that no one enjoys doing and are

therefore likely to be neglected if left unchecked. Workshops help develop an understanding of the strengths

each staff member brings to the organisation and improve collaboration by gaining an understanding of the

team’s communication style and approach to work.


Below are key highlights of TMS tools that differentiate them from other feedback instruments:


  - Based on research into work teams

  - Deals with work preference not personality (potentially less threatening)

  - Work Specific (incorporating contextual factors like role, expectations, culture, etc.)

  - Links to task and activities (Types of Work model)

  - Integrated with a suite of development tools


If you would like to discuss options and ‘best fit’, or indeed any aspect of the profiles and applications, please

don’t hesitate to contact us.


HOW DO PEOPLE USE TEAM MANAGEMENT PROFILES?


TMS provides a suite of simple, common sense, psychometric profiles, that can be used individually or as a fully

integrated system. TMS Profiles are written in positive, work-focused language. They provide valuable feedback

on areas such as leadership strengths, decision-making style, interpersonal and team building skills and job

analysis.


On a high level, TMS Profiles deliver the following benefits:


  - Proven framework to navigate change, manage projects and sustain high performance

  - Enhance individual and team productivity

  - Improve organisational communication and collaboration

  - Build more engaged and resilient organisations


26


  - Skilfully navigate conflict and difficult conversations

  - Develop balanced, high-energy teams


Some of the many applications include:


  - Team Development

  - Leadership and Management Development

  - Training and Development

  - Self-development and Career Planning

  - Negotiation and Communication

  - Onboarding


The TMS approach provides a practical model of effective teamwork which helps teams to address the questions:


  - What does each person bring to the team that adds value?

  - How do we maximise motivation and performance?

  - How can team members interact successfully with each person?

  - How do we manage the inevitable stresses and conflict?

Library/General/02.TMS External Documents/02. Current Marketing Collateral/01.Profile Flyers/TMP_ProfileFlyer


WHICH ORGANISATIONS HAVE USED TMS BEFORE?


TMS clients are broad based, spanning the corporate, government and not-for-profit sectors, and have been used

by over two million people in leading organisations worldwide (including ANZ, Qantas, Sony, Price Waterhouse

Coopers, Mobil Oil, and American Express). TMS models and concepts have been designed to ensure business

success through the development of high-performing teams, regardless of industry.


[Please refer to our website for client testimonials: https://www.teammanagementsystems.com/work-with-](https://www.teammanagementsystems.com/work-with-tms/testimonials/)

[tms/testimonials/](https://www.teammanagementsystems.com/work-with-tms/testimonials/)


CAN THE TMS PROFILE BE USED TO HELP PEOPLE FIND THE RIGHT CAREER OR ROLE?


The TMS approach is grounded in the notion of work preferences, not proficiencies. Therefore, every team role

preference type holds the potential to perform at a high level within any role. Further, most occupations demand

all Types of Work by the team member, ensuring all eight key work functions are covered.


Looking at the TMS norm data, (found in our Research Manual) different role types will skew to different major

preferences. For example, we can see that Explorer-Promoter major role preference increases by nearly 100%

between those working in Finance/Accounting and those working in Marketing/PR or Design/R&D roles.

However, it would be incorrect to assume that Explorer-Promoters make _better_ workers in Finance/Accounting. It

is more about _attractiveness_ of certain jobs and sectors, rather than competence or performance. It makes sense

that people tend to be attracted to and have the most enjoyment in roles/careers that provide them with

opportunities to express their preferences.


27


The key point here is that we find all Team Management Wheel roles in all occupations, levels and industries.

Work preferences are key factors that impact the way we do our jobs, the extent to which we search out certain

types of work and avoid others, and how long people stay in a job. However, work preferences don’t explain

everything – other factors such as skills, experience, qualifications, maturity, IQ, EQ, work culture, etc. need to be

considered.


[need to add something about the Job Match Dx tool – Toby 8/8/2023]


CAN THE TMP BE USED FOR RECRUITMENT?


In general, we **do not recommend** the TMP as a tool for recruitment and selection. A respondent's Team

Management Profile, their results, or their scores from the TMP questionnaire must never be used as the sole

criteria for a recruitment, selection, placement, promotion or termination decision. If a Team Management Profile

is to be used in an interview session for the purposes of selection, the agreement of the person being interviewed

should first be obtained.


The Types of Work Wheel can be used to undertake a job analysis. That is, what are the job activities and which

are critical for success in the role? These critical activities require people with particular abilities and preferences

and they 'make the difference' between good and poor performance in the job. For most jobs we have found that

the critical activities cover two or three sectors of the Types of Work Wheel. Although all jobs are likely to contain

all elements of the Types of Work Wheel, only some of these functions are 'critical' in each job.


The TMP can also be useful to flag interview questions. For example, if a job has an emphasis on Organising, and

the applicant's major role is Creator-Innovator, it would be useful to establish the applicant's previous experience

undertaking the Organising Types of Work. In this case, you may ask for specific instances where the applicant has

organised their work effectively, set objectives and clear goals for a project, achieved targets by organising people

and resources etc.


Finally, the Team Management Profile can be used to excellent effect in the induction process, by providing a

comprehensive approach to 'getting to know one another'. The new team member gains an insight into the way

their new colleagues prefer to work and their preferred role within a team, and vice versa. Further, introducing

the TMP and concepts at this early stage is valuable, as it's all about developing good habits and processes, and

minimising what Tuckman would refer to as 'Storming'.

TECHNICAL


HOW COMMON IS A SPLIT WHEEL AND HOW DO I EXPLAIN WHAT IT MEANS?


According to the Team Management Systems Research Manual (Fifth Edition), 19% of the database have a 2-way

Split Wheel and 3% have a 3-way Split Wheel (n= 519,303). Interestingly, 59% of all Controller-Inspectors have

some sort of Split Wheel. Split Wheels simply indicate that people like to work in different parts of the wheel.


Another consideration is when a person has undifferentiated scores (below 5) on the Four Work Preference

Measures (RIDO). This means if someone had answered just one or two questions differently, they could have

been a different role on the Team Management Wheel. It may be that people with these types of scores will feel

less connected with their profile, but this will not come as a surprise. They may say, “Sometimes I prefer to be this

way but other times I prefer to be that way”, reflecting a situational understanding of their preferences.


HOW DO YOU GET A NET ZERO SCORE?


Consider the follow example: Net scores of E:9 P:3 A/B:0 S:12.


Where a net score is zero, the person's raw scores would be equal e.g. A:18 B:18. (We take the lowest score from

the highest to give the net score). In this case: A:18 - B:18, so net is A/B:0.


WHAT DO “LOW SCORES” MEAN?


If a person's scores on the Four Work Preference Measures (RIDO) are lower than 5, we refer to them as

undifferentiated, for example E:3 P:4 A:2 S:1. In this case a slight change in preference could cause this person to

move into any part of the wheel. It is unlikely that all Four Work Preference Measures will change simultaneously.


However, changes on two work preference measures could move this person from EPAS to EPBF - Thruster
Organiser to Reporter-Adviser. When scores such as this arise, there are a few possible interpretations:


  - The person possesses genuinely balanced work preferences and can change them to suit the occasion.

  - The person may be in a state where they do not really know where their preferences lie and swing

according to the mood of the moment.

  - The person may be in a situation that is causing them to change and seek clarification of where his/her

preferences really lie.


It is likely that people with these types of scores feel less connected with their profile. They may say, 'Sometimes I

prefer to be this way but other times I prefer to be that way'. This reflects either a mature understanding of their

preferences or they may have not established any stable preferences.


The research confirms the probability of many undifferentiated scores is low, which demonstrates the Team

Management Profile Questionnaire is a reliable instrument for accurately measuring work preferences.


29


A study was conducted in 1988 to compare the TMP questionnaire scores with preferred and actual work areas.

The aim of the study was to test whether the hypotheses arising from the Types of Work Wheel can be confirmed

empirically. Are people who prefer Promoting type of work really more Extroverted and Creative than others in

reality? Are people who prefer Inspecting work more Introverted and Practical.


Subjects were, “required to fill out a questionnaire that asked them to first rank the eight Types of Work from 1 to

8 in terms of their preferences. They were then asked to do the same thing again, but this time to reflect on the

types of work they engaged in during their normal working day. Each subscale of the Team Management Profile

Questionnaire was tested in its ability to discriminate between respondents’ first major work preference and

major work activity using analysis of variance. The results indicated a definite relationship between work

preferences and all TMP questionnaire scales.


More information can be found in the Research Manual 5th Edition, pages 42-47.


**Answer to share externally:**


The E/I scale is actually net score of zero in Sam's TMP, but we never want to put zero for Relationships scale as it

is confusing, so it has been calibrated as '1', based on a complicated proprietary algorithm. When calculating

related roles E/I is considered to be 0 and so this is the first variation giving IPAS as the first related role, and ECAS


30


as the second related role. In the second example, Sean, the net score is E2 and so the normal calculation is

done.


**Internal answer (includes discussion of proprietary algorithms):**


The E/I scale is actually net score of zero in Sam's TMP, but we never want to put zero for Relationships scale as it

is confusing, so it has been calibrated as '1', based on the tie-breaking questions. Therefore, that is the first

measure to change when calculating the related role.


If the E-I net score is less than 5 (ie 0,1,2,3,4). then a search is made focusing on just the four most reliable

measures of E-I that is Q9, Q23, Q38 and Q50. If that score comes out as zero then the E-I decision is based on

just Q9. In the example above, the net score on Q9 would have been E=1. The E-I measure is probably the most

important one and we didn’t want the result here to ever be E/I=0. However when the net score on Q9 is only

one then in calculating related roles E/I is considered to be 0 and so this is the first variation giving IPAS as the

first related role. Second related role would be ECAS - Assessor Developer.


In the second example the net score is E2 and so the normal calculation is done. It’s a situation that doesn’t come

up often….

COMPARISON WITH OTHER INSTRUMENTS


WHAT ARE THE MAJOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MBTI AND TMP?


Although the TMP and MBTI are helpful tools for building self-awareness and improving team performance, there

are several key points of difference.


Firstly, although TMP and MBTI use Jungian psychology, the origins of the TMP are grounded in _**work**_, while the

MBTI is focused on _**whole-of-life**_ . The TMP recognises that people behave differently depending on circumstances

– aka work vs home. This means that the results of the TMP are context-specific, which allows for a more targeted

and meaningful work-based discussion.


Secondly, TMP focuses on _**work preference**_ as opposed to _**personality**_ (MBTI). Personality, by definition, is a

stable set of constructs; whereas TMP views work preference as dynamic and likely to change over time as we

experience different roles and organisations.


Thirdly, the TMS approach originated from research into group processes. That is, investigating the work that

teams did, rather than personality theory or psychology. Consequently, the entire approach has a foundation in

activities required for effective teamwork. Furthermore, TMP uses information about individual work preferences

to explain why people focus on some tasks, often at the expense of others. The benefit of this is there is a much

clearer link between discussions around ‘who I am’ and what it means for ‘the work I do’.


Finally, TMP tries to keep language as straightforward and work-focused as possible, using models based on

words commonly used in the workplace. This approach contrasts with the MBTI, which leverages four-letter codes

and 16 different ‘types’ – risking participant confusion. Our aim is to develop a shared and meaningful language in

the workplace to help teams communicate better.


WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DISC FRAMEWORK AND THE TMP?


VERSION 1


The TMP frames their discussion in terms of preference and opposed to DiSC which frames their discussion in

terms of behaviours. Both are equally valid but can be used to address different workplace issues. Either model is

beneficial for improving communication and reducing conflict.


However, there are several additional elements to the TMP that make it particularly useful for creating and

maintaining high performance teams.


  - The TMP can provide feedback on group communication preferences.

  - The TMP identifies the type of work people prefer to do (and are often good at), which allows a group to

allocate tasks, and play to their strengths accordingly.

  - The TMP identifies gaps in a team that can be strategically accounted for ensuring optimal performance.

  - The TMP explains different work styles and approaches so that diversity of thought can be maximised.


Both the TMP and DISC offer straight forward reporting, which is easy to understand and use for action planning.

But when it comes to team performance the TMP is one of the most researched and applied models globally.

VERSION 2


It's worth noting that, although these tools may seem similar on the surface, there are significant
differences. Although both support personal and team development, the TMP offers distinct
advantages, particularly in the context of creating and sustaining high-performance teams.

One key difference lies in the focus on work context. DiSC adopts a 'whole-of-life' perspective,
assuming consistency across various life domains. In contrast, the TMP frames discussions in terms
of workplace preferences, recognising they are situational, dynamic in nature, and can change over
time. This nuanced approach allows for more in-depth exploration during group and individual
sessions. What sets the TMP apart is its unique ability to connect work preferences with Types of
Work, offering an added dimension for team activities such as gaps-analysis, task allocation, and
leveraging differences within a team.

In summary, while both TMP and DiSC are useful tools employing uncomplicated and inclusive
language, the TMP stands out with its research-backed foundation, focus on work preferences, and
dynamic approach.


WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INSIGHTS DISCOVERY (ID) AND THE TMP?


They represent their personalities through four different colour energies


Sensing and Intuition are each within each of the four energies.


Insights measures whole of life personality and indicates that personality is fixed and rarely changes.


33


Insights measures your “conscious” and “less conscious” personality.


  - Less Conscious = Your instinctive self. How you act when you don’t think people are watching you.


Why Insights is a good tool:


  - Report is about 25 pages long.


  - The report has high face validity (My experience was that 90% of people say it’s 90% accurate)


  - Good for helping teams improve communication


  - The four colours are easy to interpret and memorable.


As an individual coaching tool Insights and the TMP would be pretty equivalent tools.


Why the TMP is better:


34


WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HERMANN BRAIN DOMINANCE INSTRUMENT (HBDI) AND THE TMP?


In regards to TMP and HBDI, both are validated tools used for coaching individuals, improving communication and

increasing team effectiveness.


While there are overlaps, the TMP is a psychology-based psychometric tool that focusses on workplace

preferences, exploring "what types of work do I prefer to do and how do I prefer to approach tasks?" The TMP is

commonly used to develop high performing teams by exploring what energises individuals in the workplace,

which can then enhance team collaboration.


HBDI on the other hand, is a brain-based assessment tool designed to assess thinking preferences and cognitive

styles, answering the question, "How do I prefer to process information?" The HBDI is commonly used for

problem-solving and decision-making. While both share the goal of improving individual and team performance,

they focus on different aspects. TMP focuses on team role preferences and contributions within a team, while

HBDI emphasises thinking styles. Even though there are overlaps, they can potentially be used alongside each

other, where the emphasis for the HBDI is on thinking styles.

THE LEADERSHIP LINKING PROFILE (LLP|360) REPORT


ARE THE LLP|360 REPORTS CUSTOMISED AND IF SO HOW MANY POSSIBLE VERSIONS ARE THERE?


The Linking Leader Profile is a customised report with a total of 234 variations. Within the report there are

thirteen sections: one for each linking skill (people, task, and leadership).


Each section contains seven paragraphs. The first paragraph provides commentary on the satisfaction rating of

that particular skill. There are four versions for this paragraph depending on the satisfaction score:


  - Very high satisfaction rating > 90%

  - High satisfaction rating <= 90% and > 75%

  - Moderate satisfaction rating <=75% and > 50%

  - Low satisfaction rating < = 50%


The remaining six paragraphs correspond to the six questions under each skill. There are three variations for each

question (Standard, A or B) depending on the following rules:


  - If there are all 'OK's everywhere (including SELF) then print file 'B'

  - If 'SELF' is 'M' and all other raters are 'OK' then print file 'A'

  - If 'SELF' is 'M' and any other rater is 'M' or '?' then print the standard file eg LSI101

  - If 'SELF' is 'OK' and any other rater is 'M' or '?' then print standard file eg LSI101

  - For any other situation no file is printed.


That gives you a combination of 3 file variations x 6 questions per skill x 13 skills = 234 variations.


[toby 24/8/23 – this doesn;’t make sense, we say there are four versions, then we say there are three versions?!?]


HOW CAN THE LLP|360 REPORTS BE USED FOR BENCHMARKING?


Primarily the LLP|360 is designed to stimulate meaningful coaching conversations and encourage leaders to

engage in participant-led discussions about potential areas for development and how to leverage their strengths.


It's important to note, that the LLP|360 is not intended for benchmarking purposes. The data within the profile is

influenced by situational dynamics and subjective perceptions of the raters, making direct comparison across

different contexts less meaningful.


Norm Data is available for the LLP|360 on page 19 of the LLP|360 Workbook. This data represents the average

ratings of importance and satisfaction from over 50,000 profiles. This data is not broken down any further by job

type or industry. This data is not meant for benchmarking, but rather to provide a broader understanding of

average ratings.


36


The algorithm for the new Linking Skills Profile has three cases where text is printed out, and there are no text

files for other cases. The cases where text is printed out are:


1. When all respondents are okay with the skill being assessed.

2. When the respondent has an 'M' rating but all others have an 'OK' rating.

3. When the respondent has an 'M' rating and at least one other respondent has a '?' or 'M' rating.


For all other cases, there will be no text file. These cases are less common and need to be interpreted using the

quantitative pages.


Summary of algorithm for new Linking Skills Profile.


37


For each question there will be one of three text files printed out, or no text file. In general, there will be 6 bullet

points but there are some instances where no file will be printed out and there will be less than 6 bullet points.


The Cases for text being printed out are:


**Case 1: OK’s for all respondents**


This will print a text similar to the following:


  - All respondents seem satisfied with how you listen. However consider how long it is before your mind

wanders off onto other things. People will always know when you are not listening as they will see your

eyes 'glaze over' when you start thinking about other things.


**Case 2: Self has an ‘M’ but all other respondents have ‘OK’**


This will print a text similar to the following:


  - Try to listen well when others are speaking to you. Switch off your 'internal dialogue' and don't 'talk to

yourself' while they are talking. Don't evaluate what they have said until they have finished saying it,

otherwise your ability to listen is reduced. How long is your attention span now? How long is it before

your mind wanders off onto other things? It interesting to note that you think you should learn to listen

better whereas your colleagues seem reasonably satisfied.


**Case 3: Self has ‘M’ and at least one other has ‘?’ or ‘M’**


This will print a text similar to the following:


  - Try to listen well when others are speaking to you. Switch off your 'internal dialogue' and don't 'talk to

yourself' while they are talking. Don't evaluate what they have said until they have finished saying it,

otherwise your ability to listen is reduced. How long is your attention span now? How long is it before

your mind wanders off onto other things?


**All other cases have no text: For example:**


  - Self ‘OK’, others containing mixture of ‘OK’ and ‘L’

  - Self ‘M’, others containing mixture of ‘L’ and ‘OK’

  - Self ‘L’, others containing mixture of ‘OK’ and ‘L’

  - Self ‘M’ others containing mixture of ‘L’ AND ‘M’

  - Self ‘M’ others containing mixture of ‘L’ AND ‘?’


{This does not apply to the two reversed questions in the Linking Leader Profile}


Cases that have no text are less common and need to be interpreted via the quantitative pages. Basically, some

people want more and others less and so it is difficult to produce useful text.

THE OPPORTUNITIES-OBSTACLES QUOTIENT (QO 2 ) PROFILE REPORT


In the Values Alignment Diagnostic Tool report, the absence of flags in certain segments indicates that the

organisational and personal values in those areas are not considered significant.


No flags will be displayed when the percentages for personal and organisational values are both less than 6.25%.

This threshold is derived from half of 12.5%, the percentage that defines which values are more important to the

respondent.


For example, in the sample report below, there are no flags in the Authority and Compliance segments:


  - Organisation/Personal - Authority: 1.4%/0.0%

  - Organisation/Personal - Compliance: 4.3%/6.4%


This lack of flags signifies that, in these specific segments, both organizational and personal values fall below the

6.25% threshold, indicating a lower level of significance for the respondent.
