Your scores are mapped onto the Opportunities-Obstacles scale, indicating the balance you have between seeing opportunities and seeing obstacles. If you always focus on opportunities, it may prevent you from seeing potential obstacles; if you focus too much on seeing obstacles, it may cause you to miss opportunities.</p>\r\n<p>On a scale ranging from 100% opportunities to 100% obstacles you scored 47.4% on the Opportunities side and 51.2% on the Obstacles side.</p>\r\n<p>The ratio of your 'Seeing Opportunities' score to your 'Seeing Obstacles' score defines your QO<sub>2</sub> – your Opportunities / Obstacles Quotient.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p>Your QO<sub>2</sub> is 0.9. This means that you are 1.1 times more likely to focus your energy on 'seeing obstacles' rather than 'seeing opportunities'.</p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p>In relation to others who have completed the instrument, you have scored more strongly on the Obstacles side of the QO<sub>2</sub> scale. This is a strength that is particularly valuable in organisations where a strong sense of reality is necessary in the way work is approached. You are particularly valuable in situations where making a wrong decision could end in disaster. Your focus on the potential problems and pitfalls in any projects you are working on may sometimes cause you to miss opportunities that come your way. In general you will not like to be in situations that are too risky and will want to be convinced that the potential pitfalls that might occur have been well thought through and factored into decision-making. As a result you are likely to be risk-averse. Looking for obstacles is important in decision-making, but so too is identifying and seizing the opportunities that are presented to you. </p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>The QO<sub>2</sub><sub> </sub>scale is a composite of five sub-scales: Moving Towards Goals Energy, Multi-Pathways, Optimism, Fault-Finding and Time Focus. These sub-scales define the Risk-Orientation Model. Around the model are your scores on each sub-scale, shown as a percentage of the maximum possible. Detailed information on each sub-scale is given on the following pages.</p>\r\n</p>\r\n</section>\r\n\r\n<section id=\"moving\">\r\n<h2>MOVING TOWARDS GOALS (MTG) ENERGY</h2>\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://api-test.tms.global//GetGraph?CreatePercentageBar&data=,38,007AC2,007AC2&clear=yes&minValue=0&maxValue=100&width=1700&type=ruler\" class=\"graph\"/>\r\n<p>\r\n<p>You scored in the lower range of 'Moving Towards Goals' Energy. While you may set a number of goals for yourself, you will probably have had mixed success in what you have achieved. When things are going well, you will probably pursue your goals energetically, but when problems arise, you may stop and wonder what to do. If the barriers seem too great, you may well turn your attention to other things. Often it is easier to save your energy for another day.</p>\r\n<p>In many of your activities you will display good confidence levels, but in some situations you will lose confidence and this may cause you to be cautious. Some of your problems may well be due to a lack of confidence rather than a lack of ability. If you have encountered a lot of barriers in your life, your determination to succeed may be lower than it used to be. Sometimes when obstacles appear in your path, you may wonder if it is worth finding that extra energy to push through the barriers to achieve what you want.  </p>\r\n<p>You are likely to set yourself goals that lie within your capabilities, as this gives you the confidence to succeed.  However, if goals are too easy to reach then your potential may not be maximised. You may consider that goals beyond your capability are too risky but try to balance this with setting yourself <span class=\"emphasis\">stretch goals</span> that will challenge you. Success at achieving goals that lie just beyond your current abilities could increase your confidence and self esteem. Some people with scores similar to yours may engage in <span class=\"emphasis\">defensive goal setting</span>.  They purposely set themselves easy goals to bolster their feelings of self-worth.  While this is fine in the short term, it needs to be followed by a purposeful goal-stretching program that brings out the untapped potential within.</p>\r\n<p>The opposite of ‘Moving Towards’ Energy is ‘Moving Away’ Energy. Unconsciously, you may put effort into finding reasons why you can't achieve the goals you set for yourself, or those that are set by other people. Some people may see this as providing excuses but it is more likely to be due to a lack of confidence, perhaps arising from past experiences.</p>\r\n</p>\r\n</section>\r\n\r\n<section id=\"multi\">\r\n<h2>MULTI-PATHWAYS</h2>\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://api-test.tms.global//GetGraph?CreatePercentageBar&data=,33,007AC2,007AC2&clear=yes&minValue=0&maxValue=100&width=1700&type=ruler\" class=\"graph\"/>\r\n<p>\r\n<p>The Multi-Pathways sub-scale measures your tendency to generate pathways around obstacles. Some people will look for just a few ways around obstacles, whereas others will generate lots of possible pathways, giving them more options.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>You scored in the low range on the Multi-Pathways sub-scale. This means that you are more likely to concentrate on just a few ways of obtaining what you want. You may believe that there is only one way to do things well, and you will often persist with one line of action until you get what you want, or you decide to direct your efforts elsewhere.  This will be more so if you also scored strongly on the MTG Energy sub-scale.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>You could be a person who likes to work to rules and procedures, as you consider that these have been designed to deliver results. You may prefer to work on projects similar to ones that you are currently involved in, where you can be sure that your abilities are being used to the best advantage.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>If you are involved with different projects, where you are working on unfamiliar tasks, you may lack confidence in your ability to deliver results. You may need to be careful that you don't reject what others are saying, just because they are proposing an unusual solution to a problem.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Your lower scores on the Multi-Pathways sub-scale may make you risk-averse when it comes to looking for ways around obstacles.  In part, this may be due to a lack of confidence in being able to identify new pathways.  If this is the case, you will benefit from studying the Multi-Pathway Generation Model, described in the accompanying Opportunities-Obstacles ebook. Here there are four generic approaches to use: Introverted Left-Brain (ILB) Thinking, Introverted Right-Brain (IRB) Thinking, Extroverted Right-Brain (ERB) Thinking, and Extroverted Left-Brain (ELB) Thinking.  More than likely you will be comfortable with one of these techniques but big improvements can be made by developing skills in the others as well.</p>\r\n</p>\r\n</section>\r\n\r\n<section id=\"optimism\">\r\n<h2>OPTIMISM</h2>\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://api-test.tms.global//GetGraph?CreatePercentageBar&data=,48,007AC2,007AC2&clear=yes&minValue=0&maxValue=100&width=1700&type=ruler\" class=\"graph\"/>\r\n<p>\r\n<p>You are a person with a cautious outlook on life, and there are times when you may be pessimistic about outcomes at work. Experiences in your life may have caused you to assume the worst, and while this can be a strength in helping you to avoid mistakes, it can also prevent you from seeing opportunities as they arise. You may have a reputation for being quite cynical, which at times may prevent you from taking action.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>When things go wrong, you may initially blame yourself rather than other people or external events. While this is an admirable characteristic, you need to consider just how much of the problem was due to you and how much it was due to circumstances which could not be predicted. Taking the blame for everything that goes wrong can have adverse affects on your life and health.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>When setbacks occur, you are more likely to consider them to be long lasting rather than temporary. This may occasionally make you despondent, which may make you reluctant to try again. Remember that persistence brings results in the end. The proverb 'If at first you don't succeed, then try, try again', is one that you could apply to your life.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>When difficulties occur in one part of your life, you may allow them to affect other unrelated parts of your life. You may need to learn how to localise unpleasant situations and prevent them from intruding upon other aspects of your life.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Your more cautious approach to life and work can be an advantage, as it will minimise the risk of failure in any projects or ventures that you undertake. You could have a tendency to dwell on certain aspects of your work, usually because you demand a lot from yourself. You probably regard this as a positive aspect as you will want to ensure that unnecessary risks are avoided. However, you may need to be aware of the impact of overthinking, where excessive reflection could cause you to delay action and ultimately lead to unnecessary stress.</p>\r\n</p>\r\n</section>\r\n\r\n<section id=\"faultfinding\">\r\n<h2>FAULT-FINDING</h2>\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://api-test.tms.global//GetGraph?CreatePercentageBar&data=,53,007AC2,007AC2&clear=yes&minValue=0&maxValue=100&width=1700&type=ruler\" class=\"graph\"/>\r\n<p>\r\n<p>The Fault-Finding sub-scale measures to what extent people put effort into examining what could possibly go wrong.  People who look only to the opportunities often forget to examine the potential obstacles that could impede progress.  Those who put most of their effort into potential obstacles analysis, may have little interest in looking for opportunities.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>On the Fault-Finding sub-scale you have scored in the higher range. At work, you may therefore be considered as a person who is quick to point out problems, and who is good at examining projects and new situations for potential difficulties. When working on a new project, you are likely to spend considerable time looking for faults and planning to avoid failure. This is a great strength, as you will be able to imagine all the problems that might occur. When new ideas are presented to you, you are likely to first look at the reasons why they might fail, rather than considering how they might be made to work. Sometimes, you may be quietly critical of people, expecting too much of them. Once someone disappoints you, you may consider them to be unreliable. This could perhaps affect your work with them in the future.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Your focus on identifying potential obstacles and finding the faults in any proposals that you are involved in may need to be better balanced with a focus on looking for opportunities, depending on the strength of your Optimism score. If your Optimism score is low then you are likely to be risk-averse. A more positive outlook might therefore enhance your life and your success at work. You may find that you are so busy working out what might go wrong, that there is no time left to be proactive. No amount of preparation can prevent failure, and the most successful people balance preparation for failure with measured risk-taking.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>If your Optimism score is high then you are likely to accept measured risks, as the effort you put into ensuring that all the obstacles have been considered will give you confidence that the risk of things going wrong has been minimised. </p>\r\n</p>\r\n</section>\r\n\r\n<section id=\"time\">\r\n<h2>TIME FOCUS</h2>\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://api-test.tms.global//GetGraph?CreatePercentageBar&data=Past;Future,70,007AC2,007AC2&clear=yes&minValue=0&maxValue=100&width=1700&type=ruler&outsideLabels=true\" class=\"graph\"/>\r\n<p>\r\n<p>The Time Focus sub-scale is a measure of psychological time - how we subjectively process time.  For some people time moves quickly, for others it moves slowly.  Some people live in the future; others long for the past; many live for the 'here and now'.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Your scores on this sub-scale indicate that you will have a Balanced time line. A time line is a continuum running from the past to the present to the future.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>A Balanced time line means that you enjoy looking to the future because you tend to see it in a positive light. However, you are also aware of the 'here and now', and are very realistic. You may sometimes dream about what might be, but you will soon regain your sense of reality. For you, the future is a happy place and you will want to be living in it, however you realise that the future also depends on the past and present and you will prefer success now, rather than waiting for the uncertainties of tomorrow.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>When you dream about the future and get carried away by changes and improvements, remember that others are firmly positioned in the present, and maybe even the past. You may need to slow down and give them time to catch up with you.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>You will recognise that many lessons can be learnt from past situations. When reviewing situations that have gone wrong, remember to encourage others, particularly those with a Future (F) time line, to learn from their experiences.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Your balanced score on the Time Focus sub-scale makes a neutral contribution to your approach to risk.  You recognise the enticement of the future but are enough of a realist to distinguish reality from an impossible dream. The other four sub-scales are likely to make a larger contribution to whether you are risk-accepting or risk-averse.</p>\r\n</p>\r\n</section>\r\n\r\n<section id=\"resilience\">\r\n<h2>RESILIENCE INDEX</h2>\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://api-test.tms.global//GetGraph?CreatePercentageBar&data=,36,007AC2,007AC2&clear=yes&minValue=0&maxValue=100&width=1700&ShowAsPercent=no&type=ruler\" class=\"graph\"/>\r\n<p>\r\n<p>Resilience describes the ability to withstand, recover from, and adapt to adversity and stress. A measure of your resilience is derived from your scores on the sub-scales of the QO<sub>2</sub>. </p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Resilience is strongly correlated with persistence and determination and the ability to look for ways around any obstacles that may arise. Personal and social competence also play a role along with the ability to bounce back from negative situations. </p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Our resilience scale is derived from a combination of your scores on MTG Energy and Multi-pathway generation as well as some of the Optimism and Time Focus items. It’s important to have both the will and the way to achieve our goals. One of the differences between optimists and resilient people is that the optimist may have a generalised expectation that things will work out whereas those with high resilience will also look for alternative pathways when blocked from a goal. If we only have the will, then we are vulnerable when obstacles arise. We are unable to generate alternative routes to our goal and therefore need extra energy to persevere in the only way we know. Resilience is also related to the ability to put the past behind us and rebound easily from adversity. Resilient people approach goals with a positive emotional state, a sense of challenge, and a focus on success. </p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Those with low resilience have lower energy available to push towards their goals and will often follow a single pathway. They may well approach goals with a negative outlook, a sense of ambivalence, and a conservative approach to risk. </p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Your Resilience Index on a scale ranging from 0 to 100, has been calculated as 36. </p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>This value is in the lower range of the scale, which means that you will probably have a lower energy level to push towards your goals and may not always be able to improvise your way around obstacles. Sometimes, you may even seem to not care about what you are doing and where you are going. You could look at how you can develop a more positive emotional state regarding your goals and what changes might be necessary to develop your resilience. It’s often useful to put the past behind you and face the future with a clean slate.</p>\r\n</p>\r\n</section>\r\n\r\n<section id=\"handling\">\r\n<h2>HANDLING CHANGE</h2>\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://api-test.tms.global//GetGraph?CreatePercentageBar&data=,50,007AC2,007AC2&clear=yes&minValue=0&maxValue=100&width=1700&ShowAsPercent=no&type=ruler\" class=\"graph\"/>\r\n<p>\r\n<p>The four sub-scales of Multi-Pathways, Optimism, Fault-Finding and Time Focus can be combined to give some indication of how you handle change. The calculation shows that you will understand the need for change, but will usually need to be convinced that it is absolutely necessary and not simply a sudden notion of someone elsewhere in the organisation. In general, you are against change for the sake of change.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>You may sometimes be resistant to new initiatives, preferring to continue with the existing procedures. Usually, this is because you prefer to work with proven approaches and may be uncomfortable in ambiguous situations. Try to keep an open mind about any changes that might be implemented, and ask others for support if you feel uncomfortable in unfamiliar situations. In particular, you will want to see how any changes affect current procedures and processes, and are more comfortable with gradual change, rather than something that is too radical.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>You may need to understand more about why you might, on occasions, resist change.  Often it is because of your perception that the obstacles associated with the changes seem insurmountable in relation to the benefits likely to accrue.  In the language of this profile you are likely to have a significantly lower QO<sub>2</sub> than those proposing the changes.  For you, it is important that all the reasons why the change initiatives might fail have been well thought through, but often those with a higher QO<sub>2</sub> may not have even considered what the obstacles are!  If this is the case you can help them by explaining carefully what objections you might have.  If this is done from a logical, analytical perspective it is likely to be well received.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Because you may not see the benefits of change as quickly as others, don't expect them to agree with you the first time you offer your views.  To you the obstacles may seem obvious but you will need to be patient and realise that others may need more time to accept what you are saying.  It is also a good idea to have done a Potential Obstacles Analysis on the issues of the change so that you can present your assessment in a clear and precise way. It may also help for you to indicate that you can see the opportunities that the changes will bring, but only after any potential problems have been factored in.</p>\r\n</p>\r\n</section>\r\n\r\n<section id=\"comparison\">\r\n<h2>COMPARISON WITH OTHER PEOPLE’S SCORES</h2>\r\n<p>The median for the QO<sub>2</sub> is 2.2 compared to your score of 0.9.</p>\r\n<h5>Median Scores</h5>\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://api-test.tms.global//GetGraph?CreateComparisonChart&width=1700&data=Obstacles,34.0,007AC2|Opportunities,75.0,007AC2&clear=yes&type=ruler&outsideLabels=true\" class=\"graph\"/>\r\n<h5>Your Scores</h5>\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://api-test.tms.global//GetGraph?CreateComparisonChart&width=1700&data=Obstacles,51.2,007AC2|Opportunities,47.4,007AC2&clear=yes&type=ruler&outsideLabels=true\" class=\"graph\"/>\r\n<p>You may be interested in how your scores compare with others who have answered the QO<sub>2</sub> Profile Questionnaire. The median scores of a development sample of 1000 respondents are shown by the top bar above. This data shows the importance of having a balance across the Opportunities-Obstacles dimension.</p>\r\n<p>Of further interest is the norm data on the five sub-scales, which allows you to interpret your scores relative to other people.  The lower quartile, median and upper quartile data are summarised below:</p>\r\n<table>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Sub-scales</th>\r\n<th>Lower Quartile</th>\r\n<th>Median</th>\r\n<th>Upper Quartile</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>MTG Energy</td><td>68%</td><td>77%</td><td>87%</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Multi-Pathways</td><td>68%</td><td>77%</td><td>86%</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Optimism</td><td>60%</td><td>70%</td><td>79%</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Fault-Finding</td><td>21%</td><td>30%</td><td>40%</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Time Focus</td><td>53%</td><td>63%</td><td>73%</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>Looking at the MTG Energy norms as an example, 25% of respondents had a score less than 68%, 50% of respondents had a score greater than 77%, and 25% of respondents had a score greater than 87%.  A similar interpretation applies to the other sub-scales.</p>\r\n</section>\r\n\r\n<section id=\"balance\">\r\n<h2>HOW TO BALANCE YOUR QO<sub>2</sub> GOALS</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n<p>You are a person who may need more energy and persistence to pursue your goals. Because a high MTG Energy is aligned with seeing and seizing opportunities, it is important to develop it to a high level.  You may well see the opportunities that come your way, but you may not always seize them. You probably need a significant increase in confidence to give you the determination to succeed in anything you try.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>You may need to check whether the goals that you set for yourself offer the right degree of challenge. If goals are easy to achieve, then you may never reach your true potential. You may have an easy and enjoyable time as you work towards your goals, but sooner or later you will realise that more could have been done with your life. On the other hand it might be that you are setting goals that lie well beyond your capabilities.  If this is the case, then no amount of rewards, or cajoling can help realise these goals.  In this situation you may well find a reason to give up as soon as you can. If this occurs then your MTG Energy will be in decline. You should reflect on which of the two above possibilities may apply to you.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Goal setting is very important for personal development.  Goals should be set that challenge and stretch the individual rather than those that are easy to reach or too far away. In sport the concept of the personal best sets the right goals. This can easily be extended to cover all parts of personal development.  You need to determine your personal best in relation to your current workload and responsibilities and then set yourself small but meaningful challenges that stretch this benchmark further. Initially, you should set goals that you know you can achieve. These can be short-term goals for a period of, say, one to three months. The achievement of these goals may then help to give you the confidence to set more ambitious and longer-term goals.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>You could also improve your level of persistence. When obstacles occur, try not to give up too easily, but make yourself put in extra effort to solve the problems facing you. Just a small increase in your determination will pay big dividends.</p>\r\n</p>\r\n</section>\r\n\r\n<section id=\"pathways\">\r\n<h2>HOW TO BALANCE YOUR QO<sub>2</sub> PATHWAYS</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n<p>Your scores on the Multi-Pathways sub-scale show that in general you will probably prefer a more traditional approach, focusing on tried and tested approaches rather than those that have no track record and therefore may be too risky. You are most comfortable working with those projects on which you have some experience, and you will be aware of many of the potential problems that could occur. However, sometimes you could miss an opportunity that arises, through your reluctance to try something different.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>You can be of great help to others in your organisation who might want to change the way of doing things without having thought through the risks. However, to improve results at work, try to be more open-minded to different approaches, by not rejecting them completely, but taking a little more time to consider the advantages of doing things differently. If the downside risk is not too great, try a different approach. You will soon learn the advantages of generating alternative ways to achieve end results.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>It is worth learning how to use the techniques for pathway generation, defined by the Multi-Pathway Generation Model.  The four thinking modes of this model are described in the Opportunities-Obstacles ebook accompanying this profile and are summarised below.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"strong\">ILB</span> (Introverted Left Brain) thinking is a logical, sequential process that helps you determine the root cause of any obstacles. Once the root cause of the obstacle is found then a pathway can be built around it.  </p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"strong\">IRB</span> (Introverted Right Brain) thinking is a technique to use when you have a mental block.  It uses techniques like visual mapping and processes such as meditation or creative visualisation, often accompanied by appropriate music to help you break through pathway blockages.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"strong\">ERB</span> (Extroverted Right Brain) thinking uses the power of the group to generate many possible pathways that you might not have thought about yourself.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"strong\">ELB</span> (Extroverted Left Brain) thinking uses the group again but this time in an objective, critical, analytical way to determine which of many pathways actually have the best chance of working.</p>\r\n</p>\r\n</section>\r\n\r\n<section id=\"stime\">\r\n<h2>HOW TO BALANCE YOUR QO<sub>2</sub> TIME FOCUS</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n<p>In relation to others, you have a Balanced time line, with a focus a bit more to the future than the past. You could therefore benefit from spending a little more time on answers to the question, ‘Where are we now?’ This will require a detailed analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats for you, your team and your organisation. By fully understanding where your team/organisation has been and where it is now, you can move it forward into the future, based on reality. By carrying out a 'history walk' with your team, it may help others to see where you want them to go. If you are already doing this, you will be well on the way to achieving a balance between focusing on the future but learning from the past.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Your enthusiasm for the future is important to the contribution that you make at work; however make sure that you are not working too far ahead of others in your team and the organisation, particularly those with a lower QO2. As a Balanced time line person with a focus to the future, you may have difficulties in interacting with some Past (P) time line people, who are more focused on the past and will tend to look to tried and tested approaches. When interacting with such people try to slow down and make the connections between what has occurred in the past, what is happening in the present and how this relates to the future that you can readily see. Point out similar successful situations in the past and show them how successful these were.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>To a Past (P) time line person, changes should be presented as small increments from what is currently happening.  No leaps should be made from the present to the future.  Each proposed change should be dealt with in detail and the links made between what is happening now and what might happen in the future. All possible problems should be identified, with adequate time allowed for the Past (P) time line people to reflect on whether every potential obstacle has been identified. This could take some time, but it is well worth the investment if it leads to acceptance rather than rejection.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Don't assume that any success you are having now can be automatically transferred to the future. Successes are usually related to specific instances and cannot always be generalised to other events.</p>\r\n</p>\r\n</section>\r\n\r\n<section id=\"obstacles\">\r\n<h2>HOW TO BALANCE YOUR QO<sub>2</sub> OBSTACLES</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n<p>When situations go wrong, we can attribute the cause to ourselves or to external events. Opportunity-oriented people often attribute problems to external events, whereas obstacle-oriented people sometimes blame setbacks on their own inadequacies. If you tend to regularly blame yourself when things go wrong, a likely consequence is low self-esteem. Rather than blaming yourself or other people, try to look at external events that may have caused the problem. Rarely are problems entirely caused by our own actions. External events over which we have no control occur constantly. Try to identify these events. It will help you to become more positive. When you achieve good results at work, reverse the scenario. Think to yourself, ‘Yes, that was largely due to me, what else would I expect?’</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>When things go wrong, opportunity-oriented people attribute the cause to specific situations, whereas obstacle-oriented people may attribute the failure to general causes. For example, if you made a serious mistake in proofreading you may be more likely to attribute the cause to general carelessness. Whereas an opportunity-oriented person might tend to say something like, ‘I hate proofreading so, of course, I am likely to make mistakes.’ Implicit in this statement is that mistake making is confined to proofreading only. So when things go wrong, ask yourself if you are being general or specific when you try to find out why. If you are attributing setbacks to a general fault in yourself, look carefully for its more specific causes.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>When major obstacles arise, do you sometimes find yourself thinking in great depth about the problem, reliving all the events that occurred? This is called 'running an internal dialogue' or ‘talking to yourself'. While it is good to analyse problems so that they don't occur again, an unchecked dialogue can lead to persistent overthinking, and unneessary pressure. If your 'self-talk' is unhelpful, try reframing it with more constructive thoughts.</p>\r\n<p>Some people find it helpful to use a simple mental or physical prompt, such as pausing for a deep breath, adjusting their posture, or lightly tapping a finger, when they notice they are focusing too much on the negative aspects of a problem. This can act as a brief mental reset. In that moment, aim to shift your internal dialogue to something more constructive or encouraging. You might think of a possible solution, recall a recent success, or focus on something that energises you to help change the direction of your thinking.</p>\r\n</p>\r\n</section>\r\n\r\n<section id=\"norm\">\r\n<h2>NORM DATA</h2>\r\n<p>For your information, some database reference material is presented below. This data shows the percentage of people sampled who have QO<sub>2</sub> scores higher than the value listed.</p>\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://api-test.tms.global//GetGraph?CreateQO2Model&type=bell&enq=0.9&clear=yes\" class=\"graph\"/>\r\n<p>\r\n<p>The norm data shows that for a development sample of people across a number of job functional areas, 25% have a QO<sub>2</sub> lower than 1.6. As your QO<sub>2</sub> is less than or equal to 1.6, you are unlikely to be influenced by over-enthusiastic colleagues who may see opportunities everywhere. You will want to carefully check that all possible obstacles have been identified and considered before moving forward. This is a great strength at work as you can help others to avoid pitfalls and costly mistakes.</p>\r\n<p>If you want to achieve a better balance in your QO<sub>2</sub>, you could look at how to further develop your skills in 'seeing opportunities', as indicated in the section ‘How to Balance Your QO<sub>2</sub>’. If you are already implementing this advice, you are well on the way to balancing the risks in any decision you take.</p>\r\n</p>\r\n</section>\r\n<section id=\"disclaimer\">\r\n<h2>DISCLAIMER</h2>\r\n<p>&copy; Team Management Systems IP, 2025, Australia.
