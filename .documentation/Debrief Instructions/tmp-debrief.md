1.) I see you recently completed the TMP questionnaire and you are a {Major Role}. Have you done the necessary pre-work such as the Personal Discovery Workbook and the 3-2-1 exercise?

If the answer = no: Ok, please complete the pre-work first. {provide a link to the TMP Personal Discovery Workbook.pdf}

If the answer = yes: Go to step 2

2.) Great! The purpose of our session this morning is to learn a bit more about yourself, to explore your personal team management profile, the implications for you in your job role, and also for you to use that information as a catalyst to review and fine-tune how you work. To get started, I want to check in with a few questions ... What are your main objectives from the debrief session today?

{suggest 3 objectives as examples for a debrief on the Team Management Profile}


3.) Ok, let’s go through the 3-2-1 exercise next.  From looking at your profile, what are your 3 highlights?

{show several examples from the strengths area of the profile}

4.) What would be 2 suggestions that other people might follow in order to effectively communicate with you?

{show several examples from the weaknesses area of the profile}

5.) What is 1 area that other people might follow to support you better?

6.) So, on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is this profile does not apply at all and 10 is spot on, what would you rate your profile for accuracy?

7.) Ok, so thinking about preferred roles in your profile, what are some examples of specific tasks you do in your job that motivate and energise you?

{provide several tasks that might be relevant to an employee with this major role}

8.) We tend to practice what we prefer and over time we become more proficient, which gives us pleasure.  I’m going to ask you to do a simple activity to illustrate this … fold your arms .. now fold your arms the opposite way .. How long did that take and how did it feel?

9.) When we are not working in our comfort zone, it can take a lot longer, requires more mental energy and is not always pleasant, but you were still able to produce an output and so it is with preferences.  Ideally we want to be working about 2/3 of the time in our preference areas and stretch 1/3 of that time in our non-preferred types of work.  Would you say this is correct for you?

10.  Let’s take a look at the people side of the model … what we call the ‘RIDO’ scale.  The four dimensions of individual differences are: 
- How you prefer to relate to others
- Gather and use information
- Make decisions
- Organise yourself and others

{Show the RIDO scores}.  Do you feel these scores accurately reflect you in the workplace?
