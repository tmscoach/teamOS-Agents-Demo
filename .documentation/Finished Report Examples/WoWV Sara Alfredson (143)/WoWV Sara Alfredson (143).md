# **INTRODUCTION TO WINDOW ON WORK VALUES**

This Profile gives you feedback on eight core value types that form the basis of behaviour in the workplace.

Values are concepts or beliefs which people use to guide their behaviour in the workplace. Values will drive our decision making and cause us to summon up energy to preserve what we believe in. They go beyond specific situations and determine how we view people, behaviour and events. Often major sources of conflict and disillusionment are due to mismatched values.

# **THE MODEL**

The different values explored in your Profile are displayed in the *Window on Work Values* model which has been developed by Dr Dick McCann from his extensive workplace experience and comprehensive research with individuals and teams. The model has been validated within a rigorous testing process and has good structural validity, meaning that values close to one another in the window are related whereas those on opposite sides of the window are unrelated. The feedback in this report is presented in a practical and accessible way but you can be confident that it is backed by the appropriate statistical research.

The model consists of eight core work value types depicted as window panes, rather like those in the rose windows of many European cathedrals. It is divided into quadrants, each containing a core value type as follows:

**Self Focus:** Value types that put personal goals ahead of group goals. *Individualism* is the core value type in this quadrant.

**Group Focus:** Value types that put group wishes ahead of individual need. *Collectivism* is the core value type.

**Organisational Constraint:** Value types that require strictly-adhered-to guidelines to ensure the smooth running of an organisation. *Compliance* is the core value type.

**Organisational Freedom:** Value types where individual behaviour is unrestricted and people are free to choose their pathways, unfettered by organisational constraints. *Empowerment* is the core value type.

Values focusing on the self, within an environment of organisational freedom are defined by the *Independence* value type. Those focusing on the self within an environment of organisational constraint are defined by the *Authority* value type.

Values focusing on the group, within an environment of organisational freedom are defined by the *Equality* value type. Those focusing on the group within an environment of organisational constraint are defined by the *Conformity* value type.

# **YOUR RESULTS**

Your responses to the profile questionnaire have been distributed across the eight panes of the *Window on Work Values*. Scores above 12.5% indicate work value types that are more important to you whereas scores below 12.5% indicate value types that are less important to you. Your hierarchy of value types (adding up to 100%) is as follows:

![](_page_3_Figure_4.jpeg)

| formity  |      | 8.4% |  |
|----------|------|------|--|
| npliance | 4.2% |      |  |
| hority   | 1.4% |      |  |

The *Self-Focus* value types (Independence, Individualism and Authority) account for 35% of your scores whereas *Group-Focus* value types (Equality, Collectivism and Conformity) account for 44.1% of your scores. This indicates the slightly greater importance you place on the needs of others rather than your own needs.

The *Organisational Freedom* value types (Independence, Empowerment and Equality) account for 51% of your scores whereas *Organisational Constraint* value types (Authority, Compliance and Conformity) account for 14% of your scores. This indicates the strong bias you have towards values that ensure you have freedom to work in your own way.

Your pattern of scoring in each of the eight window panes is described on the following pages.

# **COLLECTIVISM**

You scored in the high range on the *Collectivism* value type. This is the part of the *Window on Work Values* model that focuses on core values that enhance the working of groups or teams. However, your scores on *Individualism* also indicate that while you value being a respected member of a work group, you will want to ensure that your personal goals and work ambitions are well catered for.

*Collectivism* is a guiding principle in the way you approach work. Most often you will subordinate your own personal interests and desires to those of your group or team. For you, the best collective interests of the group are paramount in any decision-making process. However, you will act on your own without the approval of others if you are convinced it is in the best interests of your work group or team.

Harmony in the workplace is most likely of great importance to you and you will often act in a way that defuses conflict in your team or work group. Having close supportive colleagues is important in the way you live your life and therefore you will usually act so that you don't upset others.

You are a person who gives loyalty and will expect loyalty from others in return, particularly when you find yourself in difficulties. Therefore, you will be well respected at work but probably tend to keep your work relationships separate from your non-work relationships.

Above all, you are a person who values consensus decision making and will have this as a high priority, even if it means delays in taking decisions and getting into action. You will realise that effective action will only occur when everybody is committed to the same solution. Voting for a majority decision is not the way you like to work, although you will do this if unnecessary delays grind action to a halt.

You are a person who strongly values the truth; therefore, you may have little time for those people who bend the truth to suit their needs. The issue of integrity is also important to you and you will always try to act in a way that is consistent with your views. You will not be a person who is swayed by others wanting expedient solutions to difficulties. You believe in openness and will enjoy working in a group where people honestly express their opinions and where there are no hidden agendas.

Interestingly, you also have high scores on *Individualism*, and this will affect how you actually use your *Collectivism* value in practice. This combination of high scores on both ends of the *Collectivism-Individualism* pair is less common. Most likely you will value the *Individualism* characteristics of being recognised for your individual capabilities and competencies and being singled out from others for your contribution to the organisation. However, there may be, at times, competing demands on you and it could be difficult for you to get the right balance between putting your work group first while at the same time progressing your own career and acting in your own best interests.

# **EQUALITY**

You scored in the high range on the *Equality* value type. This is the part of the *Window on Work Values* model that focuses on values relating to the establishment and maintenance of the work group in a way that allows you individual freedom.

Treating everyone equally and fairly is a guiding principle in the way you approach work. You are likely to be a tolerant person and one who readily accepts the different viewpoints of people in the workplace.

Support of the weak and disadvantaged is likely to be important to you. You may well defend any members of your team or group whom you consider to be disadvantaged by the actions of others.

You will want to be in a conflict-free environment and therefore may be seen as someone who is a 'peacemaker' and who will move to diffuse potential conflict situations.

You may also be seen as an altruistic person, one who is always willing to help others and work for their benefit. For you it is important to feel that people care about you.

If you are in a leadership position you may well have a reputation as someone who puts people first and gives equal opportunities to all.

You may have difficulty in working with people who scored high on the *Authority* value type. You could see them as being into 'power' and wanting to control people's lives. You may well feel dominated by them and this could cause you to react negatively towards them.

When interacting with high *Authority* people, consider these points to help you communicate better with them:

- Realise that it is important for them to be seen to be right in front of others;
- They will have a lower tolerance for people with opposing beliefs and ideas;
- They will be ambitious and take every opportunity to push themselves forward for promotion;
- They will respond well to feedback that highlights their prowess in leadership activities.

# **EMPOWERMENT**

You scored strongly on the *Empowerment* value type. This is the part of the *Window on Work Values* model where people value a working environment where there is a degree of organisational freedom as to how people generate results.

For you, it is important to have the opportunity to contribute in a variety of ways to work projects and to be trusted that you will do your best to achieve the goals and expectations of the organisation. You will prefer situations where there is little supervision and high levels of accountability and responsibility are delegated to you and your team.

You are unlikely to be motivated solely by remuneration and material rewards and 'working for a higher purpose' is at least equally important. For you, work is to be enjoyed and rewards also come through the relationships you develop and the personal growth that comes through stretching your abilities and striving to extend your 'personal best'.

You are not necessarily a person who responds well to orders being given in a detached, compliant way and sometimes you may react badly to those who expect you to do as you are told. Occasionally you may even act to ensure that the 'orders' given to you are unsuccessfully implemented. Sticking to procedures and respect for the organisational hierarchy are not necessarily guiding principles in the way you approach work.

In general, you will have some difficulties in working with people who score high on *Compliance*. You may see them as inflexible and resistant to change. You much prefer to be around people who also see the importance of empowering others to achieve their maximum potential.

When interacting with people who score highly on the *Compliance* value type, the following points could help you improve your interaction with them:

- They will expect people to respect the organisational hierarchy and obey orders;
- They may check up on you regularly to ensure that their orders have been carried out as they specified;
- They will usually insist on following the organisational procedures;
- They value stability and are unlikely to respond well to people who want to change things.

# **INDEPENDENCE**

You scored in the high range on the *Independence* value type. This is the part of the *Window on Work Values* model where people value working with a degree of organisational freedom in a way that allows them to focus on self-needs.

*Independence* is a guiding principle for the way you prefer to work. You will want to be left to 'do your own thing' and rely on your own ability to work your way through problems. While you are courteous in your dealings with others you will not always exercise self-restraint when you are expected to conform to principles which you oppose. For you, freedom of action and the ability to exercise your own creativity are essential to your well-being at work. Above all, you are a person who values self-sufficiency.

You appreciate the need to be a team player but perhaps work best as a 'solo operator' with the freedom to pursue your own ideas, make your own decisions and stand by your actions.

You will not always respect the organisational hierarchy, particularly if senior management hold views strongly opposed to yours. Some people may even say you are a 'non-conformist'. Workplace issues such as security and safety, while seen as important, are not necessarily areas in which you would want to become personally involved.

You may not always react well to plans and goals which are imposed on you without your discussion and involvement. In these situations, you may well maintain your independence by insisting on increased levels of autonomy.

If you are working closely with people who score highly on the *Conformity* value, you may well experience some difficulties in interacting with them. They will expect you to preserve the organisation's traditions and culture and to conform to the rules and regulations. While you appreciate the importance of this approach and can understand why people embrace such values, your high need for *Independence* dictates that you will not always be a person who conforms to the organisational norms.

When interacting with high *Conformity* people, consider the following points to help you communicate better with them:

- Make allowance for their needs to work within the defined rules and regulations of their organisation;
- Show respect for the hierarchy that may exist within any group;
- Recognise that stability is preferred and avoid 'rocking the boat' unnecessarily;
- Understand their need to avoid extremes of action and to accept the current situation rather than moving to change it.

### **INDIVIDUALISM**

You scored quite strongly on the *Individualism* value type. This is the part of the *Window on Work Values* model containing values that primarily focus on the self. However, your scores on *Collectivism* also indicate that, while maintaining your individualism, you will also value being a respected member of a work group.

Being an individual is important to the way you like to work. You are more likely to believe that it is through being a strong individual and making the hard decisions when they come, that you are doing your best for your team and the organisation. Although you will care about other people with whom you work, you are quite capable of taking individual action if it is in the best interests of the organisation, although you will want to act in a way that does not upset your colleagues. For you, getting results quickly is often the most important part of doing business.

It is probably important for you to be recognised for your intelligence and competence. More than likely, you will enjoy standing out from the crowd and being praised and rewarded for your individual success. Above all you will want to be seen as a capable person.

Because of your high reliance on yourself, you may not always conform to the wishes of others and prefer to work in your own way. However, your high score on *Collectivism* means that you will balance this need with the needs of the team or group to which you belong. Relationships are important to you and you will probably have just as many outside work as you do at work.

Some people may view you as an 'individual' as you don't always take advice from others, particularly from colleagues at a similar or lower level in the organisation. You will probably consider that the value of *Individualism* has contributed to your success and it probably has. However, more than many others you try to strike the balance between your own needs and the needs of your colleagues, even if you don't always succeed.

Your high scores on *Collectivism* are likely to impact how you actually use your *Individualism* value in practice. This combination of high scores on both ends of the *Individualism-Collectivism* pair is unusual. Most likely you will value having close supportive colleagues who form a harmonious team, provided you are free to pursue goals that allow you to advance yourself. You will probably also support group decision making and consensus but could be reluctant to bow to group pressures if you see decisions going against you. At times, you may experience internal conflict, trying to balance your 'group needs' with your principles of wanting to be seen as a competent, intelligent, successful individual keen to get on in the world. Values such as these will invariable compromise those associated with *Collectivism*.

![](_page_9_Picture_0.jpeg)

# **CONFORMITY**

You scored in the moderate to low range on the *Conformity* value type.

*Conformity* is only of moderate importance in the way you prefer to work. You will not always conform to other people's expectations of you but will want to be seen as a reliable and valuable member of any team or organisation. You will not enjoy 'rocking the boat' but will if you are convinced that others are moving in the wrong direction. You will be a loyal supporter to those who put their trust in you.

In general, you are prepared to accept whatever happens provided you have freedom to explore your own creativity. You try not to show extremes of action and will generally try to fit in with those around you and not 'stand out' too much, although there may be times when you will take a more independent stand, particularly on issues you feel strongly about. You will like to have a moderate sense of security in your workplace as you like to know where you stand and what is expected of you.

You will usually enjoy being a team player although, if given the opportunity, you can be even more effective working independently on your own, with a high degree of autonomy. In making decisions you try to ensure that your actions conform to the organisational procedures and values, to which you will generally subscribe. You are probably to some extent, a supporter of the important traditions and culture of your organisation, so long as they don't compromise your independence.

You are a person conscious of the organisational hierarchy and will try to go through the proper 'channels' when undertaking important tasks and assignments, although your values of *Independence* may cause you to 'act now and ask later'.

You will usually try to exercise self-restraint in most situations as you do not like 'losing face'. You probably later regret the times when you were 'out of control'.

Interestingly, you scored high on the *Independence* value type and this may impact how you actually stick to your *Conformity* value in practice. You will probably enjoy a measure of self-reliance and set challenging goals for yourself. There may even be times when you are torn between the responsibility of conforming to the established norms of the workplace, while at the same time you may want to break out and exercise your own creativity and independence. Your need for independence may in the end win out.

![](_page_10_Picture_0.jpeg)

# **COMPLIANCE**

You scored in the lower range on the *Compliance* value type.

Being seen as a person who values *Compliance* is not the way you approach work. You may not always have great respect for people in senior positions, particularly those who tend to follow orders and impose restrictions on you. For you, while it is important to show respect for the organisational hierarchy, you may not always be as compliant and obedient as others might like, particularly with people who have let you down.

Working in a way that follows set-down procedures and policies is not something you necessarily value. You probably like people to follow your recommendations and guidelines but are well prepared for challenges and on occasions may actively seek them.

Job security and organisational stability are not really important to your well-being at work. You probably have the temperament to cope with ambiguity and fit in with changing situations.

Above all you do not like constraints imposed on you and may on occasions react negatively to those who attempt this.

![](_page_10_Picture_11.jpeg)

![](_page_11_Picture_0.jpeg)

# **AUTHORITY**

You scored in the lower range on the *Authority* value type.

Being seen as an *Authority* figure is not important in the way you approach work. The times when you actively seek to be in control of others are only so that you can achieve the best results for your team and the organisation.

You will take on the leadership role if you have to and will work hard to be effective in this area. However, you may be less interested in promotion than many others and may not always seek out new job prospects, particularly if you are happy with your current work and the only reason for changing jobs is for increased material rewards. You will prefer to be noticed by your 'good deeds' and would rather be invited to apply for job positions than have to push yourself forwards.

Being ambitious is not a guiding principle for you and you are more likely to seek a balance between your work commitments and your outside-work interests.

High remuneration will not be important to you although you are happy to receive it as a reward for your excellence and commitment to the organisation. You are more likely to be attracted to a job because of your intrinsic interest in the nature of the work you will be undertaking.

Being seen to be 'right' in front of others is also not important to you. You are unlikely to push your point of view across unless it is something you feel strongly about. You will work hard to convince people about situations you really believe in, but usually you try to be polite and diplomatic.
