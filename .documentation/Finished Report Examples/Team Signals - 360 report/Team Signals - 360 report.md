# **TEAM SIGNALS 360 REPORT**

Team Signals uses the High Energy Teams Model to assess a team's development priorities. Individual results are aggregated to display a 360-degree view of the team's responses to eight strategic development questions. Teams that have answers to each of these questions are more likely to become high-performing teams.

This report provides a clear and actionable overview of team satisfaction using a traffic light system. The Team Signals report acts as a baseline for development, a pulse check and a tool for ongoing improvement.

- **Green (above 75%)** represents areas of strength. These are the practices that a team excels at and should be leveraged further to sustain positive momentum. Reflect on what makes these areas strong and how to build on this foundation. Consider questions like: *What are we doing to maintain this strength? How can we leverage this success in other areas?*
- **Orange (between 50% 75%) or Pink (below 50%)** highlights potential opportunities for improvement. Focus on one or two key priorities to address first. Start with the foundational questions, *'Who are we?'* and *'Where are we now?'*. Ensure these are resolved before progressing to questions about direction, expectations or recognition. Addressing the questions in this sequence ensures that the development journey follows a logical and effective order. Explore questions like: *Why is this an area of concern? What can we do to tackle this challenge effectively? What steps will have the greatest impact?*

The third page of this report shows the range of responses to each question. The highest and lowest scores are indicated by the width of the band:

- **Narrow bands** indicate a consistency of the team's responses.
- **Wider bands** suggest outliers or differing perspectives, which can be investigated to understand their impact on team dynamics.
