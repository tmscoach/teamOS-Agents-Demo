# Streaming Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming for real-time chat responses, improving user experience by showing messages as they're generated rather than in blocks.

## Components Created/Modified

### 1. **ChatClientStreaming.tsx** (New)
- Enhanced version of ChatClient with full streaming support
- Handles SSE data parsing and real-time message updates
- Supports metadata updates during streaming (conversation ID, extracted data)
- Includes abort controller for canceling in-flight requests

### 2. **chat-stream/route.ts** (Existing)
- SSE endpoint that streams responses back to the client
- Sends multiple event types: metadata, extraction, message, error
- Processes extraction in parallel while streaming responses
- Uses TransformStream for efficient data streaming

### 3. **chat/page.tsx** (Modified)
- Updated to dynamically import the appropriate ChatClient
- Uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_STREAMING` environment variable to toggle between streaming and non-streaming clients
- Maintains backward compatibility with lazy loading

## Environment Configuration
Added to `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_STREAMING=true
```

## How It Works

1. **Client Side**:
   - When streaming is enabled, `ChatClientStreaming` is loaded
   - Messages are sent to `/api/agents/chat-stream` endpoint
   - Response is processed as an event stream
   - UI updates in real-time as data arrives

2. **Server Side**:
   - Creates a TransformStream for the response
   - Processes message in the background
   - Sends events as they become available:
     - `metadata`: Initial conversation data
     - `extraction`: Field extraction results
     - `message`: The actual response content
     - `[DONE]`: Signals end of stream

3. **Event Format**:
   ```
   data: {"type": "message", "content": "Hello...", "metadata": {...}}
   ```

## Benefits

1. **Improved UX**: Users see responses appearing in real-time
2. **Better Perceived Performance**: Even if total time is similar, streaming feels faster
3. **Cancellable Requests**: Users can abort long-running requests
4. **Progressive Updates**: Metadata and extraction results can be sent before the full response

## Usage

To enable streaming:
1. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_STREAMING=true` in `.env.local`
2. Restart the development server
3. The chat interface will automatically use streaming

To disable streaming:
1. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_STREAMING=false` or remove the variable
2. Restart the development server
3. The chat interface will fall back to the standard request/response model

## Future Enhancements

1. **True Token Streaming**: Modify the agent response generation to stream tokens as they're generated
2. **Typing Indicators**: Show when the agent is "thinking" or processing
3. **Progress Updates**: For long-running operations, send progress events
4. **Streaming Extraction**: Stream extraction results as fields are identified
